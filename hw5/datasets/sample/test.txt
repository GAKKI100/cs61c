U0o92C-o3neVTcE7nSeoeA 1 easy access to the store with ample parking if you want to be offered services you dont need and given incorrect promo info with no assistance on purchas products this is the placecame here with my son to pick up an online order and to have him look at phones i got my phone and that was that no offer to help set it up or tell me about cool features i had to ask i could sense the reluctance but my phone was set up then strong push for direct tv and a home alarmno acknowledgement of my son who was looking at phones whom i asked in front of the agent if he found something he did still no acknowledgement so we left will probably get it online or find a store more willing to help i miss the store inside pv mall they were a 6 out of 5 sad they closed
