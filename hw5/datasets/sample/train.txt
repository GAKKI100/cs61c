x7mDIiDB3jEiPGPHOmDzyw 1 the pizza was okay not the best ive had i prefer biaggios on flamingo  fort apache the chef there can make a much better ny style pizza the pizzeria  cosmo was over priced for the quality and lack of personality in the food biaggios is a much better pick if youre going for italian  family owned home made recipes people that actually care if you like their food you dont get that at a pizzeria in a casino i dont care what you say
dDl8zu1vWPdKGihJrwQbpw 5 i love this place my fiance and i go here atleast once a week the portions are huge food is amazing i love their carne asada they have great lunch specials leticia is super nice and cares about what you think of her restaurant you have to try their cheese enchiladas too the sauce is different and amazing

Er4NBWCmCD4nM8_p1GRdow 1 back in 20052007 this place was my favorite thai place ever id go here alllll the time i never had any complaints once they started to get more known and got busy their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half i have a huge problem with paying more for way less food the last time i went there i had the pork pad se ew and it tasted good but i finished my plate and was still hungry i used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a hello melissa nice to see you again diet coke  pad thai or pad se ew now a days i know she still knows me but she disregards my presence also i had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me great food but not worth the money i havent been back in over a year because i refuse to pay 1015 for dinner and still be hungry after sorry pinkaow you are not what you used to be

brokEno2n7s4vrwmmUdr9w 5 if you like thai food you have to try the original thai bbq their pad se ew is to die for their thai egg rolls are delicious basil beef will not let you down its not on the menu anymore you have to ask for it yes the building is not as fancy as some other places yes ive batted a fly off my plate more than once yes i do not go to the bathroom their because i dont even want to know what it looks like but the thai food is the best in town the service rocks and you can get a 25 gift cert on restaurantcom for 2 can you beat that i think notthis is the only place my husband and i go for anniversarys date nights birthdays anything i recommend it to everyone i know if you know good thai food go here
kUZWBVZvhWuC8TWUg5AYyA 5 amazing i was referred here by a friend and at first thought korean and mexican weird i dont know but my husband and i were in the area and thought why not lets try it after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place we tried the chimichanga and it was absolutely amazing we actually did 12 chicken 12 beef have you ever been to a place that will make a burrito half and half i havent the meat has fantastic flavor im not a beef girl but id order a whole plate of their beef  its that good the chimichanga was huge enough for both of us to share it and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious and we were full and it was 11 total with drinks you cant beat thatthe service was great the server was so nice and attentive you could tell she was the owner the only thing id change is their chips they serve they were burnt too thick and kind of bland but their salsa is great and lets face it im fat so i we ate two baskets anyway so they cant be that bad lolall in all food was delicious a lot of food for cheap great prices great service great flavor hell even my burps taste delicious bahaha
wcqt0III88LEcm19IxFFyA 3 ribs  amazing2 hour wait time not so amazing but understandable this place would get 5 stars if they expanded their bbq restaurant their ribs are amazing you get so much food for the price and it tastes sooo good plus the two hour wait isnt always a bad thing because it gives you an excuse to drink and gamble while you wait
LWUtqzNthMM3vpWZIFBlPw 1 food is pretty good not gonna lie but you have to make sacrifices if you choose to eat there it literally takes an hour to an hour and a half to deliver food seriously every single time doesnt matter if we order at 8am 10am or 1pm never fails they take forever if you dont get what you ordered or you are upset by them delivering your breakfast around lunch time be ready to have the owner talk down to you and be a total bitch to you for i dont know just wanting what you pay for its over priced but its decently tasteful food takes forever owners a witch and im pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off end rant ps ive never gone in there to eat because i frankly id rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area pps my hot chocolate today was cold they should call it cold chocolate or start caring if their hot chocolate is hot one of the two would be great
STiFMww2z31siPY7BWNC2g 5 i have been an emerald club member for a number of years  i have always been very satisfied with their vehicles and customer service  this recent visit to pittsburgh was no exception
HkYqGb0Gplmmk-xlHTRBoA 1 the score should be negative its horrible the have like 67 items in their buffet no naans or salad the items were either bland or stale my friend had a potato curry which was completely stale without salt the biriyani was okayish but bland would never recommend to anyone

kS4hrhEScwB9V5JATYjvVQ 5 sansotei serves some top notch ramen they take no reservations so my company of five had to wait outside for about half an hour i guess its normal for saturday night unlike my favorite ramen place in nyc you can only order whats on a menu no deviations or improvisations whatsoever our waitress didnt speak much english and even after writing everything down still managed to make a mistake or two but my spicy sesame ramen called tan tan was exceptional i can tell you that just the right thickness of broth and taste  omg

7EgEjUpcb8q-B5dPCMvkaQ 1 food was alright the service was horrible both of our orders came out incorrect after waiting extremely long because they dont write anything down when they take the orders i asked for greens at the end she confirmed did you say grits i said no greens please still ended up with grits boyfriends whole order came out wrong and when they brought him back the right order pretty sure they brought out my grits they took back 5 min before from my wrong order and gave them to him waitress came back and just set the plate down and walked off no sorry about that does it look right now do you need anything else just straight nothing never came by our whole meal to check on us

MTrzrLQT_LK2VLK9xantHw 1 if i could leave zero stars i would this rude b at the door with the fake lashes and colored lens was super rude we had entered the club earlier and upon leaving the guy at the door told us we could come back later for the show but when we came back one man let us through up to the door but the b there said there was no reentry she then proceeded to tell us that we could talk to the guy by the exit okay well fyi if youve never been to a venue you dont know exactly where everything is we walked away and looked around and werent sure where she was referring to so we went back and asked where the exit was she rudely responded i said go see the guy by the exit over there  felicia basically everyone was rude not coming back

85DRIjwPJOTb4q0qOlBstw 1 i wish i could tell you all about the food but there was problem my friend and went there for dinner we were seated quickly unfortunately it was in middle of the empty dinning room so we asked to be moved to the side which we were upon sitting down we were told we could only have one of the very small table tops there were two together so the hostess told us the manager said we couldnt use two table tops in the empty restaurant so we got up and left with the manager chasing us blaming the hostess for the the ridiculous action needles to say we will never return

YDJDfKnx6VpMMo4EBxycGg 1 nonexistened service  the waiter did not even great us and did not listen to me about ordering so my male companion had to repeat it to him then many people different people tossed our food on the table while passing by without any word or an eye contact naan bread arrived much later from the soup its a shame that such a dreadful worse than a fast food corner restaurant occupies area in the heart of the torontos entertainment district run away  dont spend your money there
