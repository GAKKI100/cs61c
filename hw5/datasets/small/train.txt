x7mDIiDB3jEiPGPHOmDzyw 1 the pizza was okay not the best ive had i prefer biaggios on flamingo  fort apache the chef there can make a much better ny style pizza the pizzeria  cosmo was over priced for the quality and lack of personality in the food biaggios is a much better pick if youre going for italian  family owned home made recipes people that actually care if you like their food you dont get that at a pizzeria in a casino i dont care what you say

wcqt0III88LEcm19IxFFyA 3 ribs  amazing2 hour wait time not so amazing but understandable this place would get 5 stars if they expanded their bbq restaurant their ribs are amazing you get so much food for the price and it tastes sooo good plus the two hour wait isnt always a bad thing because it gives you an excuse to drink and gamble while you wait
LWUtqzNthMM3vpWZIFBlPw 1 food is pretty good not gonna lie but you have to make sacrifices if you choose to eat there it literally takes an hour to an hour and a half to deliver food seriously every single time doesnt matter if we order at 8am 10am or 1pm never fails they take forever if you dont get what you ordered or you are upset by them delivering your breakfast around lunch time be ready to have the owner talk down to you and be a total bitch to you for i dont know just wanting what you pay for its over priced but its decently tasteful food takes forever owners a witch and im pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off end rant ps ive never gone in there to eat because i frankly id rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area pps my hot chocolate today was cold they should call it cold chocolate or start caring if their hot chocolate is hot one of the two would be great

kS4hrhEScwB9V5JATYjvVQ 5 sansotei serves some top notch ramen they take no reservations so my company of five had to wait outside for about half an hour i guess its normal for saturday night unlike my favorite ramen place in nyc you can only order whats on a menu no deviations or improvisations whatsoever our waitress didnt speak much english and even after writing everything down still managed to make a mistake or two but my spicy sesame ramen called tan tan was exceptional i can tell you that just the right thickness of broth and taste  omg

ozsPsDFRmha9HH-nVVfilg 5 weve come here several times over a few years its always been clean we go in the evenings the service is great they are all really nice but not excessively chipper to the point of being fake theres always so much to choose from we always need a minute to decide kids love the baskets and also the burgers cheese curds and concrete mixers are their faves i like the rueben but its so hearty i cant finish it all at once the dinners are a great value too pot roast with salad and a roll yuuuuummmmm
k35JcHzHaXwEAEEqan-TaQ 3 place is always packed for weekend dinners harder to get in if theres more than a party for twogiant portions love that theres enough to share or to munch on the followinh day  cheese crisp and pzookie are our motivation to come here wish tables were not too close together but i get its part of their charm plus that would mean less tables and then there  would be a longer wait 
AGBMkc677SGy4q4RbG1NAg 1 where to begin 1st timer at amc desert ridge excited because of the recliner seats overwhelmed when we stepped inside the marketplace waswell we thought it was like a hospital cafeteria with a lot less staff and a giant mess popcorn all over the floors and counters condiments spilled condiment droppings on the counter saw 2 girls with brooms  not cleaning but chatting it up with the cashiergotta line up 3 times one to order another to pay and another to pick up your order pure confusion for a 1st timer so you go back front and back liked the soda machine cause you pick and mix the bar it looks like  and afterthought with i think 5 stoolsthe bathroom gross 4 stalls not completely flushed and 1 with wet droppings on the floor 2 sinks without soap and the used papertowels were overflowing the automatic machine was rolling the new ones into the used ones did i mention there was redbrown debris on the stainless steel ok recliners but i doubt anyone actually measured the distance from the screen to the seats because we were on 2nd to last row and it still felt too close we got a headache

spH5FCYkWPHWYVvzt1M_Gw 5 we just had my sons 6th birthday party here today the party was a combination of laser tag and arcade games  we were greeted with a warm welcome upon arriving and staff was very attentive to us throughout the party collin was amazing with keeping the party flowing and helping out with everything from the set up serving of the food to the clean up at the end the price was right and i would highly recommend king putt on stephanie in henderson if you are looking into booking a party here
202H71EF9UnErHrX3fAipA 5 it is a very  nice place at first my husband and i saw the ad on the local chinese paper and decided to give it a try it turned out to be great the massage was professional and the environment was very nice i love the background muscic as well at the price of 30 for for 70munitesfootmassage it is well worthy the money
mnh4yY2_jIupURg1r_8pXw 1 i would have to say my husband and i are very disappointed about the professional photos jon took for me which i had planned to use for my upcoming job application we searched yelp and found him with all good reviews which made us decide to go to him for these very important pictures the results are very disappointing jon seems to be a friendly person except that in the beginning he tried to deny a yelp deal that we purchased as he claimed the deal is for family photos only which was not said in the deal description when we purchased anyhow he accepted the deal we bought eventually however it turned out to be a terrible experience  first of all his studio is in his house or maybe more specifically in his garage certainly it is not fun to take a onehourphotoshoot at such a place when the temperature is over 100 outside and there is limited airconditioning in the garage he had to use a fan trying to make it cooler but most importantly his technique is not very impressive at all  my green dress turned out to be blue in my photos the skin tone of my face in the pictures turned out to be uneven despite the fact i was put on makeup by professional beauty artist also his socalled touchups of the pictures are awful that he didnt even try to take the shines on my face away  as a matter of fact i dont think those pictures we purchased have been touched up at all  i am not sure if he is good at taking family pictures as other claimed in the reviews but if you go for professional headshots i wont recommend him at all it will be a total waste of your money and time
q6ij-nz5d_hvdjuelho1pQ 5 better service and much better prices than the dealership these guys take great care of your car without sticking it to you price wise like the dealership does wont go anywhere else
Am8VMrPYMl9WGCpA4ji-gg 1 probably the worst experience at a hotel in vegas ive ever had  all of the construction was completely annoying but one of the dealers in particular was pretty much a racist and decided to get in a raciallymotivated political debate with me  completely inappropriate  she also wouldnt stop complaining about how shes made minimum wage there for like 10 years which says something about their judgement to employ someone like that for 10 years without firing them  she also made me feel really guilty for dropping a few hundred dollars at the blackjack table instead of tipping her that money  i wish i had someone to report her to but they dont really seem to care  i will never be staying at this hotel ever again and would never suggest that anyone else does either especially with all of the competition on the strip  you can do much better
QHueaxKHuBpbDOkWb0Cyfw 1 people pleasethe only good thing about this place is the ever apologetic staff  i didnt come here for the food but rather the bourbon list as i was told it was amazingthe bourbon list was if fact amazingproblem was they actually didnt carry any of the bourbon on the listafter being told up front all of the pappy van winkle was out of stock they list like 6 of them on their menu i was shot down on my next 5 attempts to order a bourbonall put of stock  really  the bartender kept apologizing profusely but it was apparently all ongoing issue  dont waste you time herefor the bourbon any way
66FSK2J1uHJqVI1Z8QiFGw 3 i love how they have no rice sushi options they have a pretty good list of sushi and the sauces that they use for it food came out at a timely manner and service was not bad
smfJ-FC5iokX7AbGbTMD4Q 3 i really wanted to like this place a lot of my friends have mentioned this restaurant and stated how much they enjoyed the food so my boyfriend and i decided to stop by last weekend first off they have an amazing staff very nice and accommodating the hostess was great and our server was on top of everything we really appreciated him informing us that he was going on break and to let the other server know if we needed anything to just ask however we never saw anyone for the last 20 minutes that we were there they were very busy so we decided not to stay any longer and just walked up to someone at the bar and asked for assistancethe food what can i say the chicken satay was amazing and i loved the peanut sauce i ordered the panang curry and my bf ordered the yellow curry i think we love the flavor but i was disappointed at the amount of chicken they put which was barely any at all in the generous bowl of curry they served it with it was mainly vegetables and i had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken hoping there was more at the bottom i hate to do this but i have to stress how very little meat there was in there   a few minutes later our pad thai arrived the noodles were completely white and the entire dish basically tasted like noodles with lime juice  veggies wheres the rest of the sauce the only reason i gave three stars is because i liked the staff and the atmosphere i dont think ill be coming back unless one of my friends who love this place really wants to go
1QR6BgzXhpo7ngGEw-BW4w 5 had the ruby salad carpaccio salmon and ravioli everything was literally amazing we had an amazing server as well i have not one thing bad to say about this restaurant
gh5kRC3s_77jZBUo1Ctw_g 1 stay away because i moved this was the closest to my new home i had my oil and filter changed here about a month ago and after a week my oil change light came on my bf mentioned maybe the guy just forgot to reset it so he reset it for me last week it came on again and turned off after a few hours the next day it was on all day my bf decided to change the oil and filter himself and showed me that someone wrote on the filter to make sure we know it was changed and the date said july 2016 see picture posted this place hasnt changed my filter the both times ive come to them after telling them i need an oil and filter change both times i was also told it will take about 40min but only took 10 did they even check anything else  and i love how both times they asked if i was paying cash and when i told them cash both times theyre machinecomputer was down so they were unable to print me a receiptwhatre you guys doing in there
uXoexzu7jA3U0qoR5M6opA 5 ive been to a few ramen places in town and came here with my friend whos a big ramen fan we love how tender the meat was and the broth was perfect not too salty and greasy like other places weve been too most of all amazing service as well new ramen spot for us
5k9F53Lanw09xR3nwCdRYg 5 i had an amazing time here they were very busy but service was great all employees were making a team effort to acknowledge every guest and were very engaging we ate at the bar which i feel gave us a better experience as first timers we ordered about 7 items and i absolutely loved every single one of them the fish entree and oyster rockefellers were my favorite the food came out one after the other and on time i love when i dont have to wait too long for my food on a busy night and still have it come out presentable and taste amazing i didnt get a chance to try their sushi but im coming back here with my girlfriends after they saw my post see you again soon
Fv1cqziL1JShSztJWYkTcA 3 ive been coming here for a while and i love how the food tastes the same every time delicious i always either get the panang pad thai fried rice larb andor chicken satay service is always great i dont think i ever remember have bad or mediocre service here and the food always comes out just in time im giving it 4 stars because the food to price ratio doesnt match to me i always end up either ordering more or stopping by somewhere later because im still hungry i think they should either lower the price or add more food just my opinion
AxhxGl41DItKjqkzYtr53Q 1 2 of my girlfriends recommended this place so all 3 of us went i made sure to have an appetite when i got here sushi was mediocre what made it terrible was the service we were there for 2 and a half hours because our orders took about 30 min to come out whether it was appetizers or sushi our servers excuse was because the bar was full so youre telling me your main dining area which was actually also pretty full  should suffer just because the bar was full someone replied to this comment saying to come on a monday when its not busy umm so i have to come a different day to get even mediocre service no thanks
lAyATpsxALW9owlSKhSozA 5 vickie makes me feel so comfortable every time i go to her she never rushes anything and shes very thorough and gentle ive tried 3 different types of wax and hers is by far the best one she explains every after care products she uses on me and i love that if a product doesnt sit well with me she immediately tells me not to use it and doesnt push me to use it she even suggests other products that she doesnt carry just so we find something that works well with my skin she definitely has my best interest at heart thank you vickie
_qIXejLYgWGYYtcGcMw1eg 3 the halohalo was good i got the mango toast and was a bit disappointed the taste was very plain and didnt have a lot going on to it but the presentation was cute i think it was a little over priced i could get halohalo just as good for cheaper
5sXSVB7QiNx87XkhNSs01A 5 ive had samples of their ice cream which are also very good but i always go back to the ferrero rocher
sJybnuOiOY9yb3WwdQuTTA 5 im not good at explaining how i want my hair since i always change it up every time i see her but she is always on point my hairdresser for the past 3 years and i have never left disappointed xoxo
BC2-Mup-2YPJPpcihNoa9A 5 ive been here a few times with my family and theres really nothing for me to complain about their service is on point if not gets better every time we eat here the taste of the food is always consistent and the serving you get for the price is great ive read plenty of comments about the service maybe you guys should make sure your staff is consistent with the service id really hate to come here one day and end up with a server who doesnt take care of us
mqhCY5oLA1LXP6gZ3JQDTQ 3 the spicy wonton was my favorite we ordered another round of it and the potstickers i had the shang beef noodle soup which was good but wouldve been better if it wasnt too salty i also had a taste of my friends order of the peking zha jiang noodles which was okay
2Hk7DNwu3rb2jKHaFfPyCA 3 it might be a bit unfair to review globe so early into their existence but i dont feel too badly about it reason being this isnt their first restaurant opening globe has two other locations so its owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant but rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared and the place generally seemed like it probably wasnt ready to open just yet im going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of globeglobes focus is on local stuff that means they try to only serve products that are made closetohome trouble is im not exactly sure how far that closetohome boundary extends to i was told that it includes ontario as a whole but it could also go much further east or west their albacore tuna for example comes from bc and their mussels come from pei other items dont explicitly explain where they come from like the cornish hen thats the difficulty with going local though rightoffthebat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries bc and pei after all arent right around the corner why not maine lobster maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in bci suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff then why not do it right down to the last detail why have a couple of wines from italy and the us when you could easily make a wine menu completely from niagara peninsula wines or even from west coast british columbia since we havent yet established where that local line is drawn i suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now considering the whole farmtotable trend but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite to me thats what true local eating is all about setting firm boundariesthe main thing that caught me right awayeven more so than the localness of stuffwas the truly reasonable prices at my initial walkin to the beautiful dining room i expected to pay a bit more but that wasnt the case at all starters are around 11 bucks entrees are around 22 at prices like that its even kind of refreshing considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are and the food is good too the local carnivore flatbread for example had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious goodquality meats the baked spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach but the contrast worked nicely togetherthe dining room space is beautiful 20 foot ceilings elegant lighting solid wooden tables in terms of sheer ambience and sophistication theres nothing in bloor west village that can even come close to competing with globedespite the wandering servers we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better if we had another server i probably would have thought a lot lesstruth be told globes focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion however despite that it was a pretty good overall experience opening jitters and stage fright aside i think that once they work all the kinks out therell be nothing in bloor west villagean area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin withthat can even come close to competing with globe
D2TcNaPqXxDGQ6T0n-vHXw 3 i have been itching to get to origin for months now after a friend of mine had gone and raved about the food i dug the concept tapas with a twist this is definitely not your traditional spanish tapas at origin youll sample small plates with asian italian and latin influences i didnt find the menu overwhelming but our server was more than happy to help steer the meal so that similar and complimentary flavours were eaten togetherit was tough to narrow it down as we would have been happy with just about anything on the menu we started with the tostones smashed flattened and deepfried plantains with guacamole on the side the plantains were very well seasoned with generous use of kosher salt and a light dusting of curry powdernext up were the deviled eggs with smoked bacon and gremolata and the smoked cod croquettes with saffron aioli both were a big hit at the table disappearing in a flash i preferred the croquettes of the two but i didnt exactly not eat my share of the deviled eggs eitherthose scrumptious bites devoured we ordered another bottle of wine three cheers for monday night dinners with lots of wine and anticipated the arrival of more delectable plates while we waited we marveled at the strangeness of the cutlery provided the only way to balance your knife was blade up that seemeddangerous especially after the third glass of cabernet sauvignonour next dish appeared and we dove right back in carefully so as not to cut ourselves on our upturned knives a gorgeouslypresented order from the mozzarella bar bufala mozzarella with pear rosemary oil pine nuts that was drizzled with honey and placed on a crunchy toasted slice of calabrese breadnext up was the bangkok beef salad with peanuts mint mango fried shallots and a sweet and sour dressing there was a moment of hesitation while we all tried to dance around the fact that splitting this thing among the three of us might get violent in the end however we shared well our kindergarten teachers would be so proud this wasnt an exceptionally complicated dish but it was done to perfection the beef was tender and pink the mangoes were ripe and slippery the shallots and peanuts added the crunch the dish needed and the cilantro added the wonderful bright note at the end it should be noted that my friend said it was the third time shed had this particular dish and it was exactly the same every time that is a sign of a great restaurantour final round of food was to arrive and we were practically giddy with excitement we had decided on the chinois duck with pickled cucumber hoisin and sriracha sauce on a chive pancake the curried shrimp with naan and the misoglazed black cod with soba noodles and a ginger vinaigrette we knew each dish would be good but didnt know how good we had spent the first half of the meal happily eating away and we were by no means disappointed with our choices but these last three dishes absolutely blew them all out of the water the duck was crispy and i must say substantial the kitchen does not scrimp on the portions at all with this dish the sweet hoisin sauce was a great compliment to the duck and the heat of the sriracha a definite mustorder at originnext up we attacked the curried shrimp which was intensely flavoured and perfectly spicy the soft aromatic naan bread sopped up the spicy broth that was left after devouring the plump juicy shrimp another dish that hit its markfinally and kind of sadly we came to our last dish the black cod black cod is one my favourite fish and i have it a fair bit when i was out in vancouver earlier this year i had it almost once a day but this black cod might be the best ive hadever it was flaky tender and moist the miso glaze was pleasantly salty and the skin most importantly was nice and crispy the soba noodles were served with the ginger vinaigrette and by the time we were done there was literally nothing left on the plate in all likelihood the best dish of the night though the three of us never could decide on a clear winner in that categoryall in all i would definitely recommend origin to anyone who has some reasonably adventurous taste buds and who is willing to share there is one composed plate that makes a meal  a burger combo with spanish fries and a float i have no doubt its delicious but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this go with friends go on a date go with family its not a cheap night out but it is most definitely money well spent
Vtd6Tqm7YMfRTBFLtZIoOQ 1 alright alright so as it turns out i sometimes judge a book by its cover or in this case a bar by its signage lets face it im a sucker for good signage and souz dal has it the rusty globe hangs outside like a relic the name of the bar cut into the side lit and glowingfrom within it reminds me of one of those tin punchout crafts made from a insert random legume canat summer camp but much cooler of course it was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion beckoning me in when i had somewhere else to be finally one night a couple of weeks ago i gave in to its sirens call i was a little bit disappointedit was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender i say lonely butjudging by his charm see none he probably liked it better thatway granted though it was early  souz dal only has a drink menu  and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore onthe stars i gave are attributed solelyto the bars ambience dimly lit and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy ormoorish feel to it worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls while candles flicker on every table casting shadows the back patio has a similar vibe happening cloistered in by high walls andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottlesnow i rarely turn down a good patio but in this case i chose aseat inside which says a lotreclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window we watched college street come alive as we perused the drink menu i was in a cocktail mood and my friend had read somewhere that souz dal claimed to have the best mojitos in the city so that was the first order i placed now ive been to cuba i did a little backpacking starting in havanaand makingmy way to the south coast i wouldnt say im a connoiseur of the mojito because of this but i diddrink my fair share and like to think i know a thing or two about a good one and this wasnt one of them there wasnt nearly enough mint or sugar so it was overwhelmingly bitter i dont like my mojitos to taste like koolaid but i do like a little sweetness to curb the edge unlikely to order another of the same but unwilling to give up on the bar we tried a few other beverages nothing wowed us the moscow mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn but it also wasnt a repeat offender the fortune cookie garnish on the lycheeinfused soho martini was fun but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been although funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me a good drink means even more so chancesare iwont be returning to souz dal if however you are in the market for an intimate date setting see empty bar then head on over and if a mediocre mojito is your thing then you can get them herefor 575 on mondays
ZOBEhxOeMnncqIJFkGumRA 3 away from the hubbub of the annex and little korea sushi joints become fewer and further between on a relatively quiet stretch of bloor west between dovercourt and dufferin sits mazz sushian unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years mazz sushi has been one of the few sushi options for bloorcourt and bloordale residents each time i visit i am amazed by how bustling a place it is with the constant turning of tables and the rapid fire filling of takeout bagson a recent weeknight excursion the small dining room was full with a great mix of students parents with young children and older couples a typical audience for mazz soon the servers were trying to accommodate extra guests and pointing out that it would be a 10 to 15 minute wait for a tableseated with menus in hand the server soon appeared with the tea that was barely just ordered mazzs tea is very earthy in flavour with a hint of barley moving on quickly to another table he left us to continue to ponder the menus not returning for quite some timeupon his return we quickly placed our order for various maki and sashimi hoping that the busyness of the place wouldnt slow the normally lightningquick serviceafter a moment he returned with a bowl of congee and an amusebouche of marinated tofu dont be alarmed these are mazzs welcome dishes i find the tofu pleasant enough but the congee seems a little too heavy and porridgelike to start a mealbefore these two were done he was back again with the ubiquitous miso soup and house salad the soup was seasoned and flavourful with lots of nori and tofu the salad was a small mixture of iceberg lettuce with some vegetable shavings and slices by the book but not out of this worldjust as we were finishing our appetizers the first of our rolls arrived we ordered a spicy tuna maki tuna mixed with crumbled tempura and hot sauce my guest not a fan of spicy food likes mazzs version as she doesnt normally find it too spicy unfortunately this time they were a little too spicy for her good for me but bad for her a minor thing but consistency means repeat businessnext the rest of our food arrived a sashimi dinner and dynamite roll the sashimi dinner is always a joy at mazz and this time was no different the plate usually contains a nice selection of tuna white tuna salmon and possibly mackerel and always has more pieces then advertised this time was no different and the fish was very fresh the only complaint and ive found this happens quite regularly in toronto is that the white tuna was served too cold the dynamite roll was large but a little tasteless seemingly prepared in too much of a hurry a couple of pieces unraveled and fell apart on the plateoverall mazz sushi let us down a little on this visit the staff seemed rushed and unable to provide the consistency that we have come to expect not once during our meal were we offered more tea a slight unheardof in a sushi restaurant the food although served quickly wasnt up to their usual standards and the wait to order was long and although it remains quite inexpensive the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system
fWdhtaQld99jXB-N9yu1tg 1 if youve ever driven by high park on bloor street seen the streetlevel sign that advertises 3 dollar breakfast and considered stopping in to check it out youre probably lucky you didnt sure i know the breakfast is only 3 dollars so i probably shouldnt be hard on it but regardless of price id still like my meal to be served hot and be put together with some level of care and attentionthis is a pretty mediocre breakfast here a slice of warm ham a strip of old bacon browned toast overundercooked eggs leftover potatoes breakfast served here is lessthanspectacular and the service staff doesnt seem to care if you complain about it im sure theyve heard it all countless times beforeall of this of course is served in one torontos prized possessions high park if it wasnt for the location i certainly would have given them 1 star in fact it wasnt for the location i probably wouldnt have eaten there at all and in some strange way i almost wish i didnt eat there that way the ad on bloor street could have remained some mystical promise of a tasty hot and friendlyserved breakfast somewhere in the heart of high park
t98usw-bvob9JqMJPvvnsw 3 uncle bettys is a family foodie heaven the sole toronto provider of new yorks famous dreesens doughnuts a colourful ice cream and dessert bar warm and fuzzy comfort food and a small selection of beer and wine for the grownups in the crowd all make this a popular place for parents and kids alike uncle bettys has only been open for a few months but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following we went to uncle bettys on a bustling friday night looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere uncle bettys certainly provided both painted in bright blue and cheery orange lots of seating inside and a small patio off the front we felt right at home several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow as the evening wore on though most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirtysomethings looking for a cool place to hang outoffering sandwiches burgers hot dogs salads and many other of uncle bettys specialty creations the menu is fairly extensive and varied we ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad and the grilled cheese sandwich which was made with homemade macandcheese and meatloaf stuffed inside their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety which i am sure we will try on our next outing both meals were great the vegetable sandwich was warm the cheese was nicely melted and the bread was crisp the grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the best ever however the portion size was on the small side for a 15 sandwich both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food for dessert we each tried a dreesens cinnamon sugar doughnut made fresh on site and although they were pretty tasty i am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time it is far too bright and colourful to miss with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose fromthe service was friendly and attentive and we had a conversation with the owner samara melanson as we were leaving samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant and its always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from she told us that chef paul lampa was brought over from coquine restaurant which explains the gourmet comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients most appetizers are priced from 6  10 dollars entrees varied in price from about 9  15 dollars and wine and beer was in the 6  8 range and uncle bettys carries kicking horse coffee which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this torontotransplanted western girl bettys also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch with homestyle blueberry pancake and uncle bettys own take on eggs benny which comes served on a doughnut  we will definitely be back to uncle bettys to try some of the other great entrees on the menu and  of course to dig into their ice cream bar
0RqkBJegJpH7thxPTL30NA 3 i am the first to admit that i dont know roncesvalles village well a friend used to live there many moons ago but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer in recent years however the lure of the restaurants lining roncesvalles ave has drawn me to the west side of the city more frequently i never know quite what to expect when i arrive but i am always pleasantly surprisedone such surprise awaited me at the ace i had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages even that it had once been a chinese restaurant now headed up by chef peter mcknight it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food fried chicken burgers soup shepherds pie while the menu has changed the dcor most certainly did not the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950s feelmy friend and i settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen when asked what wed like to drink i tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight well no taps that i recognized anyway our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps  a great aesthetic touch behind the barwe submitted our drink orders  mill st for me the ace manhattan for my friend  and took stock of the menu  written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose we pondered several options but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a christmas burger the whole plan changed ground turkey with stuffing in the middle topped with cranberry chutney this had to be eaten as delicious as it sounded it was actually better than anticipated  it hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes also sampled were the deepfried brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous briny oysters both were truly excellent and personified what the ace is all about simple food done perfectly my dining companion and i nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the brussels sprouts something i truly thought would never ever happen in my lifetime if youre at the ace do not miss the fried chicken which is succulent juicy and crispy served with him gravy collard greens and cornbread though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while the fresh pasta with tuna chiles plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature texture and flavor no matter how full you may be from the wellsized  portions i implore you not to skip dessert the ice cream in particular is outstanding do not miss the oatmeal stout or chocolaterosemary concoctions they are all made inhouse and i am not ashamed to admit that i asked for an entire vat of the chocolaterosemary ice cream to take home so that i could swim in it seriously do not miss dessertby the time we left around 8pm the ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable homey environment with excellent comfort food attentive staff and a great bartender i would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm as evidenced by the perpetually foggedover front window  go early or go late or go for brunch you wont be disappointed
TiicMquFOQFF7_-SNnyBww 3 can i get a whopper not anymorea former burger king at bathurst and bloor has become the second toronto location for the vancouver dynamo chain its easy enough to almost walk past guu sakabarnicknamed guu 2as you travel down bloor street the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal as are the windows once you do see it though the slatecoloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractiveinside things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables unlike the church street location this guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to deshoe before being seated on the floor actually you wont find a typical table anywhere at guu sakabar in the main dining room the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tableswith your friends or with strangers if youre uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar but fair warning you will be right in the thick of thingsthis restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience from the time you enter to the time you leave youll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant they boisterously welcome you when you enter and give you a loud farewell when you leave i would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this but i think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around i almost expected the happy birthday chant to be lowkey as an ironic contrast but they dont miss a beat the entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you even the chefs behind the counterwith that in mind this has to be one of the most welltrained service and kitchen staff ive ever come across i went to guu 2 on a tuesday evening and it was jampacked between seating guests taking orders delivering orders cooking clearing and processing payments i have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers guu has raised the bar for what i believe a wellworking service staff is capable of i will say that a couple of our orders that i consider starters like salads and sashimi came out last but the dishes are small and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters the organization and teamwork is impeccable we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us it seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing awesomewell to me a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesnt hold up so i am happy to say that the food on this japanese tapasstyle menu does have a strong voice even in this noisy dining rooma variety of dishes are offered from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus a souffl of tender octopus and creamy cheese and fried skewers of quail egg each items price point is around what i expect from a tapas restaurant but the servings are very substantial the sashimi salad 780 in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily or four people with ease the sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only 680one benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out one by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going pastquite simply the food is great and you certainly get more than what you pay for it was just a fun dining experience to be a part of and i did feel as though we were part of it you may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard but at the same time youll be smiling while doing it
OV_95Q6-zyRAn2hGDAXX3A 1 food like fashion has a lot to do with trends every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere someone does it well and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywherea number of years ago it was the burrito soon the poutine became chiclately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best southernstyle barbequeon a recent saturday night i had the opportunity to eat at lou dawgs southern sandwiches at king and portland in the entertainment district nestled in the basement lou dawgs seems to be punching above its weight it has a fairly small front of house and on this night a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up and once they did it was loud not only that it wasnt even music the sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall despite that the place was buzzing pretty much all the tables were full and the youngish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough with tables full of plates and pintswith our large order placed at the bar we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table no sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive it was super quick and it couldnt have been more than five minutes my guests and i ordered the gamut of the menu pulled chicken beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad coleslaw and a loutine poutine with pulled pork everything looked greatthe pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note there wasnt that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque the pulled chicken was very dry this is a dish most people have difficulty doing well and i dont think lou dawgs is any different it seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile waiting for someone to order it the beef brisket was popping with flavour it was succulent with just the right amount of fattiness if youre there i highly recommend itside dishes is where lou dawgs really shines their coleslaw is creamy sweet and crisp with dried cranberries and raisins and the potato salad truly made with love it burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texturethe small poutine was quite a large portion the fries were as they should be crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting if the cheese was curds you couldnt tell they had lost all of their consistency from over heating the chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled porkoverall lou dawgs didnt live up to the hype ive had better southern barbeque at places that dont specialize in it and way better at places that do coupled with that the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself is it trying to be a restaurant a sports bar or a neighbourhood performance space or just a hangout for friends of the staff this indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place so while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to there wasnt much keeping me from going somewhere else
ujMcxx-EzqTHht2ZtsiQ1w 5 the high park neighbourhood is nearvoid of good places to grab a pint well it was until the mugshot tavern opened anyways the mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void and then some truly nice owners delicious food and a killer environment this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what its expected to beif the mugshot doesnt have the best draft selection in a 10 km radius it certainly has the most wellthoughtout one these guys obviously love beer and more obviously is that theyve put a ton of thought into what is being pulled from the taps its all craft beer and some interesting stuff at that chances are they have a few youve never even heard of like the king pilsner and warthog ale it wouldnt be a stretch to say that theyre probably one of only a handful of places in the city with either on tap dont expect to find canadian or blue here what they offer is much more creative than any of that stuffthe food and the entire menu for that matter is equally wellthought out its a killer mix of southernsoul and comfort food and they do a dam fine job of pulling it off you can expect to find southern favorites like fried chicken with fritters and some not so expected ones like inhousemade corn dogs with chutney the presentation is pretty decent too and again goes beyond the typical bar stuff its pretty obvious that the people manning the kitchen know what the hell theyre doing back there rarely do i go to a restaurant and have difficulty deciding what to order at the mugshot i was torn between a few itemstheyve done a dam good job of ridding the place of all remnants of the defunct mckenzies that used to take up the place theyve clearly spent a lot of time thought and energy turning it into something completely new the environment painted in bright red and tactfully covered in oldschool famous mugshot photos is easily the kind of space you could hang out for a long long time its comfortable and welcoming the way a neighbourhood local should be despite not being an overly large place it still accommodates nicely and any excess people can spill onto their cozy rooftop patioand the staff at mugshot they couldnt be any friendlier having only been open about a week or so youd never know it by their attitudes likely working long hours roundtheclock getting the place ready and established theyre still sociable outgoing and friendly i sureashell didnt feel like a stranger in this joint and i dont think anyone with even the teeniest bit of personality would either even coming in by yourself is sure to get you some conversationits clear that after just opening theyre still trying to establish their crowd its still sorta random as to the people that might be in there while one day the bar could be full of seniors that evening it could be packed with a younger crowd it seems to be dependent on the time of day but its also unfortunately the way the neighbourhood seems to work customers are sorta like family you cant really pick emthe mugshot isnt just the kind of place you sit drink and hide from the world although it provides that pretty well its also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space in a neighbourhood like high park the mugshot tavern is unrivaled in every respect
Wcquaa9O-kUULSFeV38hFQ 3 located at the top of the restaurant strip on roncesvalles the westerly is a cozy neighbourhood spot that is sure to please  the uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming coowner tom who presided over the evening with grace and warmthwe spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual while we deliberated a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia ive had in a long time arrived at the table the crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last longafter a solid twenty minutes of deliberation we placed our orders the romaine heart salad to split two ways steamed pei mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries roasted chicken supreme stuffed with pulled pork yes you read that right served with bacon  smoked cheddar israeli couscous the house burger made with ground chuck veal and braised short rib panseared arctic char served atop israeli couscous with lobster and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and musselswhen the food arrived five sets of eyes widened the plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic  im lucky enough to have friends who share so i got a little of everyones meal while all were delicious there were a few outstanding bites that i would return for which i would the westerly in a heartbeat the israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and surprisingly not heavy at all the smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls infusing them with a ton of flavour  next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as i ate it juice running down my hands it came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully  undoubtedly this is a big crowd pleaserbetween the two fish dishes i preferred the halibut i liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde there was certainly nothing wrong with the char  it was rich not overcooked and the lobsterladen israeli couscous was excellent the balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish though really appealed to me and i will likely order it upon my next visitamazingly we had some room left for shared desserts i opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart the crumble was comforting filled with cinnamon and topped with large buttery pieces of crumble incredible definitely a great end to a meal but i recommend sharing as it is quite heavy  otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant pants unzippedi would return to the westerly unquestionably my friends and i had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well though there was some miscommunication with a dessert it was rectified gracefully  if you havent been add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner
RCTkfcQKczfUhtV1Hz58jA 5 5 doors north is my neighbourhood spot i have visited it on several occasions and each time i leave i debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush my conscience prevails as 5 doors north is too great of a restaurant not to review and share with my fellow tofoodreviews readersa spur of the moment thursday night out decision led andy and i to 5 doors north knowing we would get a great meal we were seated in the front area of the dining room perfect for people watching along the eglintondavisville and yonge street corridor the furnishings are worn kitschy and mismatched but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant  the restaurant menu is handwritten and photocopied followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard which are carefully selected and always guaranteed to be greatthe wine list is small and filled with some robust reds i ordered the pinot noir which i have to say just didnt do it for me it was a bit thin and wasnt quite what i was hoping for andys malbec was fabulous so we both ordered another glass for the second round wines by the glass are anywhere from 7 to 11 and bottles in the 3050 range overall wines are priced fairly well but i would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menuthe appetizer list is long and everything sounds incredible they have smoked salmon prosciutto mussels a delicious polenta dish on top of the list of daily specials which included cauliflower soup avocado bruschetta and crab cakes we went with the soup beef carpaccio with pecorino cheese  roasted onion and the beet salad first out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli  lotus chips which was wonderful the goat cheese soft and warm and the beets sweet and crunchy the roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy but not too heavy a perfect start to the meal and the beef carpaccio was some of the best the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectlyfor our mains i ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola special and andy the braised brisket ravioli the meals were incredible the gnocchi was awesome fresh and soft but the real winner was the gorgonzola cream sauce so creamy it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week but so worth it garnished with scallions and fresh pepper the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the gorgonzolathe braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had i was unsure what to expect but the beef was perfect meltinyourmouth wrapped in fresh pasta with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce it would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu as this dish just has to be triedthe prices are right entres run from 1420 with appetizers in the 812 range the service is extremely friendly with everyone pitching in to seat serve and checkin its a family run restaurant and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 doors north as much as you will

jz8200YeNwsIqa2yImVO_g 1 one of the worst bar experiences ive ever had the servers dont care if youre there and they probably wouldnt care if you showed up at all theyre far too busy chatting with each other about how beautiful and amazing and important they are to care about customers avoid
UvJkZ8bvLj9iuerrawgoQg 1 i know some people are going to completely disagree with my 1 star rating here and to be honest 10 years ago i would have thought the same but considering how much the culture of greek food on the danforth has evolved in the past 10 years mr greek seems to have been left far far behindmr greek has slid to becoming nothing more than a glorified cafeteria that might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though because ive been to some cafeterias that arent absolutely horriblei remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki but what youre presented with now is nothing close to decent the souvlaki is tough and tasteless the rice is lukewarm and overcooked the vegetables were likely previously frozen bottom line is this is in no way an accurate representation of what greek food is in toronto add in the sweaty pushy serving staff and you have an all around poor dining experiencei actually complained via email last time i went and i promptly received an email back from the owner full of profuse apologies and promises of a better meal nicer service and an overall better experience if i returned although i appreciated his effort the last thing i want is to be forced another meal there i know restaurants can have a bad day and im willing to overlook that but from what i saw this was just another day in the life of crappy restaurant living of its achievements in the distant paston a street with as many options as the danforth theres absolutley no reason or excuse to end up in this joint
qn8taSTZERfaR6cPBEiOOA 3 since it opened this place has become a west toronto local favourite and whats not to love huge slices with fresh ingredients at reasonable prices while i defintely have had better pizza before for something quick fairly inexpensive and reasonably tasty there isnt much within walking distance that beats it just stay away at noon during the week or the highschool crowd will eat you alive if you cant make it in they have delivery available too
ytMNnwPkSBxmixfOrC--1Q 3 having a craving for something spiced and exotic and motivated by a friends comments that there is a good indian place over on queen i ventured out in hopes of finding something deliciously curried upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on queen west where a string of three of four indian restaurants are all lined up sidebyside so which to chooseone thing i love about toronto restaurants that you wont always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building  little india stood out for its wellorganized easy to understand and wellpriced menu  in we wentit is definitely an intimate spot having no real capacity to hold very large groups but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo it was a cold thursday night and not overly busy so it did not feel crowded and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentivethe menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes the price range is about 15  20 for an entre but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or naan and which dont so that you can order them on the side  first up was the mixed platter appetizer which included samosas onion bhajia pakora and spring rolls everything was crispy hot and just the right size for something before the entreand it came in at under 5for the main i ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the madras chicken  fair warning if they tell you its going to be hot then its truly hot  we are all too accustomed to those canadianized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses and it is arguable that little india may do this too but in any case take the servers recommendations to heart  i do enjoy some heat but my taste buds cant handle extremes so i steered clear on this occasionexcept for a little taste of the madras  for those of you who do like spice youll love this  it has that heat that creeps up after a few bites not that punchinthefaceburn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in franks red hot our server did lean my friend toward the lessspicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first much to her dismay but as it turns out his suggestion right on  as for my tamer dish it had more of a mediterranean flavour to it grilled lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro  it was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winterone of the greatest things about this restaurant is something i was not even able to take advantage of the lunch buffet  this is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace but for those of you in the area i say go for it  buffets have a bit of a bad reputation and for the most part its welldeserved but a small arrangement at a nonchain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu especially if it is food youre mostly unfamiliar withoverall i cant leave you saying it was the very best indian cuisine ive ever had but i can say that i wasnt disappointed and i would go back againespecially for that buffet
lWZbF7GrYb8YFne_HN7m0w 3 i heart churros  at least thats what the button said that was given to me by the man behind the counter at panchos bakery  after noticing the small collection i have attached to both my bag and jacket he was quick to give me a new addition  i was hesitant to let it join the ranks after all i heart anything is a pretty bold statement and to be honest as of that moment i had never had a mind blowing churro experience or at least one that would have me declaring such strong feelings for them  the only time i ever ate a churro was at an establishment once promoted by a talking chihuahua so you can understand my hesitation  i pocketed the button as its fate would be determined laterpanchos bakery makes up a portion of what is titled the latin american food court in kensington market  the tiny little storefront on augusta avenue is deceiving as it houses more businesses than i would have guessed  assuming it was only panchos in the building i was surprised and excited to see a stall selling tacos another dealing in empanadas and the infamous popup agave y aguacate  panchos itself occupies the space right up front across from the korean dumpling stand im not sure exactly how they fit in  apparently the latin american food court doesnt discriminate and why should they  dumplings are tasty and well im sure another vendor only helps pay the rentit was around twelve oclock on a friday when my friend and i decided to check out panchos neither of us had eaten but we couldnt quite justify having churros for lunch we are of the mindset however that believes dinner shouldnt be the only meal followed by dessert so our afternoon repast that day would have a churro chaserfull of carnitas tacos and kimchi empanadas korean dumpling cart influence but not too full to pass up deepfried dough we made our way back to panchos  i was promptly questioned as to the whereabouts of my button but i quickly placed my order as a distractionthe churros at panchos are piped out in the front window and brought to life for all too see before quickly being led to their delicious demise in the deep fryer  they are served hot either plain or filled with your choice of chocolate dulce de leche or strawberry syrup  we ordered four one of each flavour and a plain  at my servers recommendation i also grabbed some bread pudding and traditional mexican concha bread  as we had lost our seats there arent many to begin with and the sun was shining we took our treats to gowe started with the chocolate moved on to the dulce de leche followed by the strawberry and thus ended anticlimactically with the plain they were crispy and sugar coated on the outside while soft and with the exception of the plain accompanied with a burst of sweetness from within churro rookies be warned a churro is a like a deep fried dough straw  any filling that goes in the top will ultimately come out the bottom  we left a sticky trail through the streets of kensington that led back to panchos  if hansel and gretel only knew about these they would have rethought the breadcrumb idealater at home i popped the bread pudding and concha into the oven  concha is a sweet bread that resembles a clam shell hence the name  it tasted a little of brown sugar but overall it was bland  i think the idea however is to serve it alongside a cup of caf con leche or hot chocolate and get to dunking  i could see this working in its favourthe bread pudding however traditionally served around this time of year to be eaten for lent was delicious  dense but very moist and just sweet enough my girlfriend went nuts over it apparently she doesnt have a problem with dessert after other meals either  and this time it was breakfastnow im not a fan of donuts and the churro is essentially the donuts spanish cousin but i would take a panchos churro over a donut any day and these are what i will return for  as it turns out i really do heart churros after all  now where did i put that button
hiGKbKVj4hlF7GoNer4epA 3 we were invited last week to attend a new menu tasting event at company resto bar in mississauga across from square one shopping centerfirst impressions were that this restaurant is huge its a good spot if you are looking to throw a largegroup party or corporate event dinner they definitely have room to accommodate large groups for dinner and drinksthe menu is set up with shareable appetizers as well as traditional entrees we tried a variety of starters all which ranged from 1350 to 1650first we tried the louisiana shrimp po boys this sharable serving came with three po boy sliders along with a helping of fries the shrimp were lightly spiced instead of battered like a traditional poboy sandwich and were served with creole tartar sauce lettuce and tomatoes the buns were a bit oversized for the shrimp in the sandwiches something tells me they are better suited for the hamburger sliders also on the menunext up for appetizers is the charcuterie flatbread this was a great value the flatbread that came to our table was the size of a small pizza each of us had a few pieces which is a great size for an appetizer as a big fan of a traditional charcuterie board i was interested in trying this out and was pleasantly surprised the meat was not overpowered by the cheese tomato and sauce base on the flatbread would highly recommend this onetraditional entrees were next i tried the surf n turf a new menu item which was 29 i really liked the unique presentation which each item set up on a long board instead of a traditional steak and potatoes plate the steak was cooked exactly as i requested the lobster tail was a generous size and the lemongarlic butter sauce wasnt overpowering at all it was cooked perfectly too and was very meatyunfortunately the double cheese baked potato was very dry it seems like they are premade and had cheese asparagus and shallots added and reheated a simply baked potato would have been a better choice for this one the attempt at an added flair didnt add much to this dishunder recommendation from our waitress we also tried the penne jambalaya this huge helping of pasta came with big chunks of chorizo chicken breast and shrimp in a sambucca cajun cream sauce the sauce tasted a lot like vodka sauce for those who have never tried sambucca before the portion size was impressive and the pasta had a good kick of spice to it too definitely a win and at 19 it was well worth itonce 10pm hit the music was turned up to a deafening level and other tables of guests began to arrive including a few party groups with bottle service for the night we decided it was time to ask for dessert so we could head on our way the brownie cookie stack arrived at our table with fanfare a huge firework candle drew the attention from the tables around us as it arrived it would be great for a birthday party or function but as a regular dessert accompaniment it was a little over the top again we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size a stack of 4 huge thick brownie and chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry drizzle all for 10 although the presentation was amazing the ice cream and sauce just couldnt bring out enough from the cookies which were warm but werent very moist or chewyoverall the food is comparable to a lot of nightclubrestaurants on king street in toronto but at a more affordable price range and without the 60minute wait for a table the service was great from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening this might not be the best choice
ZXfIARFQ5sKpO0IEdc9qlw 3 joy bistro is a beautiful sophisticated resto just inside leslieville on torontos east side its likely that youve heard of it or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage its become somewhat of a leslieville landmarkfirst things first ive heard a lot of negative comments about this place by the sounds of it its one of those places thats hitormiss and completely different from one visit to the next amazing one time awful the next because ive never had dinner there i cant vouch for evening dining but i can say this if you truly dont want run the risk of being disappointed stick with their weekend brunch this place is known for brunch while they may have their issues joy bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of stylebrunch at joy bistro is not really bistroish the brunch food here is mostly just what youd expect to see on a brunch menu in most toronto restaurants but they do their brunch stuff particularly well eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like benetine with spinach and peameal bacon norwegien with stacked smoked salmon and teddy with peameal bacon roasted tomatoes and spinach with their nearperfect hollandaise eggs benny at joy bistro is a solid choicethat and theyve got a killer patio intimate and relaxing their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences leslieville has got a few patio spots but for sheer space warmth and location sitting on a busy little leslieville corner overlooking jimmie simpson park joy bistros patio is in a league of its own worth the sit down in the summertheyve recently undergone mass renos which has resulted in joy bistro bar although this may have helped the space modernize its also contributed to changing their clientele base neighbourhood locals that frequented joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over i guess as leslieville becomes more popular joy bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood and while change can be good in most cases if it isnt broke them why fix itdespite that new clientele its still a great place for brunch so the next time a nice summer weekend rolls around head out to joy bistro for brunch on the patio by the sounds of it though i certainly wouldnt do anything but brunch
070Mmij4jDIqLV-Cy5w7bw 3 so lately ive been on a bit of an italian kick maybe its the changing of the seasons and im subconsciously trying to carboload for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation whatever it is this past monday i was looking for just that at terroni on queen west the camp is divided on terroni people either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers the nosubstitution rule or the sliceityourself pizza being a fan of this place i have a rebuttal for each of these complaints while some of the servers may seem a bit curt at first i owe this to the fact that terroni is busy  always busy  and their nononsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness our server although brusque took our order diligently while complementing our choices had our wine to the table in no time and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere which is something we later failed to do as for the nosubsitutions rule if you want to choose your own toppings then head on down to that infamous subpar pizza joint you know the onewith its orange boxes and redundant title and stuff your crust while youre at it since when did slicing pizza become a chore just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila freshly sliced pizza    regardless of the division terroni is always packed monday at 900 found us one free table upstairs which was where our preference lay anyway although i do love to pull up to the bar it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level and while the upstairs isnt exactly quiet shouting across the table isnt required our waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twentynine  yes twentynine  pizzas they have to offer  we started with the funghi assoluti 1295  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula sprinkled with parmesan and drizzled with a balsamic glaze  it was superb but sharing proved to be problematic not because the portion wasnt large enough but because we simply didnt want to social graces saved us but i had visions of the two of us in an animal planetesque showdown circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised  we chased all of this down with a velvety piemonte that was oddly served in a jug which made it difficult to pour our server made it look effortless but us well we just made a mess i did manage to solve the problem however pour from the side and not from the oddly shaped lip and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre no sooner had we finished sharing the last shroom was our pizza delivered to the table we went with the primavera 1595 to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy all of the pizza at terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes red pepper more mushrooms and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie now when i say thincrust i mean it  maybe im just speaking for myself here but i have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at terroni im a big fan of folding slices before biting into them and the crust at terroni is so thin and pliable i always envision myself folding a whole pizza in halfand then in half againand then having my way with it  once again as with the sharing social norms seem to get in the way
MhkLj0c7EjcasKObXbr35A 3 torontonians have welcomed momofuku with open arms and with satisfied stomachs last month david chang founder of momofuku and internationally renowned chef was in toronto to play host in an unexpected arena the tiff food on film series he joined a soldout theatre of fellow foodies including us to watch his favourite culinary film ang lees eat drink man woman and then engaged the audience in an informal qa session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chefhoodthree hours of salivating over delectable chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn so we decided to check out changs momofuku daisho shortly aftermomofuku daishos ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience its open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic modern feel after a successful debut in nyc  sydney chang was lured to toronto by what he says was a perfect and unique opportunity presented by the shangrila hotel to house three different takes on his cooking in 1 single buildingwith the accessible noodle bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre and walletbusting venture to the toprated shoto we were eager to try our hand at momofuku daisho a midlevel offering that centers the menu around preordered familystyle dishesas you can probably imagine it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance of which we were but eager to get the full experience we preordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs the waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order on account of the deluge of food on the way warning consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the preorder on a doover we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menufirst we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled chilliinfused cucumbers if these cucumbers are the asian take on bread and butter the west is in more trouble than economists predictnext came the spicy sausage and rice cake dish inspired by chinese szechuan cuisine these meltinyourmouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and asian greens are a quintessential menu creation packing flavour of momofukian proportionswe then indulged in a momofuku classic a porkstyle bun this time of the deboned chicken wing variety coupled with dill a glazey hot sauce and crudit a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7and then the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory included with vegetables scallion pancakes oily and delicious and a fancy soya type saucelastly we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white kimchi bean sprouts and some sticky white rice in our notsohumble opinion the ribs were a tad on the fatty sidewe decided to end the night right and order the chocolate  five different textures of it a healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity an interesting experience but wed suggest the more intimate smaller size even for a larger group like oursall in all we were blissfully overfed at momofuku daisho it was lovely dining with david chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic good friends and good food  what could be better
ssYFA8RHnSTnulzUgjotcA 3 much like ed hos recent earth bloor west endeavour globe bistros focus is on local and simple myself i find that to be a beautiful combination if its pulled off right that iscut off from the cozy front bar space you cant help but notice how welcoming globes dining room is distinguishingly set tables character hardwood floors and an interesting play on shadows and lighting all come together to create a soft and intimate space it draws you in as soon as you enter and it gives you the feeling that youre in for something specialwith considerate friendly detail orientated staff the service at globe doesnt disappoint while it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table no matter what business youre in that type of attention scores big pointstrouble is i was there to eat and most of the food at globe fell a little flattheres a lot to be said about going local with hype from the 100 mile challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable people are looking for food thats produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint while globes focus may be on local its hard to identify exactly how close local is since they have items sourced from as far as kelowna and vancouverthe west coast dungeness crab starter was overcomplicated which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating besides the obvious crab meat which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked the plate also had a fartolarge savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn yep popcorn while the consistencies were actually pretty good it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanationthe second winds farm elk main was a little too simple too little color not enough flavor and effortless presentation while the elk loin was perfectly cooked the braised shoulder was tough and neartasteless the best part of the dish was the corn polentamuch the same with the pheasant which also served the meat two ways while the citrus breast was moist and tasty the jerked leg was tough and lacking spicesits really too bad because i truly wanted to love globe from the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff i was sure i was in for something specialperhaps simpler is better especially since what were talking about here is a focus on local ingredients great cooking is all about balance and if globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes like the crab starter and making others slightly more complicated like the elk main and identify where they draw the line on being local theyd have nothing stopping them
YCilP6BtVj-3Pjq3uTXVwA 1 for those that dont know onoir is that unique place where you dine entirely in the dark yes it is completely pitchblack and no your eyes will not eventually adjust you cant see a dam thing down there in onoirs dark and dingy basement dining roomseriously though onoir is easily one of the worst dining experiences ive ever had in toronto not just because the food and service were awful but also because i left the place feeling ripped off onoir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it it was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights offfirst off the food at onoir is horrible its just glorified hotel banquet food you know the stuff salad with balsamic vinaigrette precooked steamtableheld vegetables chicken with coriander sauce it was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s theres nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here the food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light youd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight theyd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses like food with strong aromas or flavours nope just unthoughtful crappy food in a way the food was so bad that im glad my other senses werent heightened by the lack of lighti ordered the surprise menu i mean really why wouldnt i id like to at least try to see if i could use my enhanced senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was i was eating for me the surprise was that i still dont know what the hell i ate no one ever told me i sort of assumed that once we were finished eating the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions but nope he just took our plates away without any explanation at allspeaking of our server he was one of the worst in the biz not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up but he was inattentive and bored i dont blame him though itd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of onoir he often left us wondering where he was not because we were in the dark but because he often left the room or crept up behind usthe seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too especially if youre part of a group in a dark environment youd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation our seating arrangements at a long rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alonesitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too believe it or not the servers actually signal that theyre entering the room by banging on the door we must have heard it 40 or 50 times in a room that is supposed to heighten your senses this seems absolutely ridiculous surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters if there is onoir didnt figure it out or they didnt care they just decided to stick with the loud bangingalthough we couldnt see anything a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotelstyle metal chairs and wooden tables i mean i know we cant see anything anyways but if our senses were supposed to be heightened then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that you could argue that because youre eating in the dark the restaurant doesnt need to spend as much on the space but id argue that because youre eating in the dark the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into considerationon the way out the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel and right then it all made sense to me this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel it explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture it confirmed one thing for me if youre going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose theres little doubt that because they didnt onoir sees little repeat business people come for the novelty but likely leave disappointedonoir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off absolutely nothing more than that the pitchblack did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway i was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark
4T3tLnPK6MntQAPVItIEFg 1 having grown up enjoying pubs far and wide it doesnt take much to cajole me into visiting the newest local for a pint and bite to eat this was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at axis gastropub on the corner of bloor and markham in mirvish villageaxis sits in the old roccos plum tomato location and is the sister pub to axis gallery and grill in the junction this corner seems to be one of the those bermuda triangle hospitality locations with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again maybe the axis folks will succeed where others have notarriving a number of us remarked that the large room decorated in a modern style was a little stark and very empty for the time of day it certainly didnt scream pubwithin seconds we were greeted by the two serversbartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever wed like both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the daytaking a large table in the back of the room we sat chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appearedperusing the menu it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone the choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with build your own pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pastaat the servers recommendation we tried the pulled pork nachos what came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings tasty but not remarkable in any way and the amount of toppingless dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of okay not stellar not that spicy following another suggestion my axis club sandwich soon arrived a pub staple the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs this club was well prepared but again not remarkable combining chicken breast ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard much like what youd find in a veteran diner or truck stopoverall axis gastropub does not live up to its name it doesnt really feel like a pub and there isnt anything remarkable about the food maybe it is a case of higher expectations but i cant imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby
dp6rinVjRXYaAABTU6BYsA 3 sometimes i ride the 501 streetcar just for something to do  its a fun way to people watch without really having to watch out for them but its also a great way to spot new businesses or old ones for that matter  the past couple of times i took this trip i wondered what was in the chalkboardblack building on the corner of queen and elm grove  i assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space and i was half right  the mascot is a coffee shop that showcases artor an art gallery that serves coffee depending on what youre going for i guess  i myself was going for the coffeeat first the place is a bit daunting  its quite large with a lot of negative space and very limited seating  there are two barstools at the counter a few tables that can seat more than one and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken  the back room which houses the artwork offers up a couple victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture an old elementary school chairdesk combo and a springy antique rocking horse   im not quite sure if that last option is for display only or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia but i for one wasnt about to find out  i used to have one of those horses and i remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis  luckily for us there was a free tablemy girlfriend ordered a latte while i went with just a basic drip to see what reunion island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state  i shouldve went with the latte  not that the drip was bad but the latte was fantastic it was smooth and strong without being bitter the rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well  it should be noted that i went back a few days later for my very own  as it was around the brunch hour and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee  the edible portion of the menu at the mascot is provided by omg baked goods and like the seating selection is limited  the cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury so we ordered a ham  cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccaciathe quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first  we both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed but ive definitely had better quiche  the stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise  it didnt come to the table looking like much really just a bun on a plate  but as with all things stuffed its whats inside that counts  filled with roasted peppers artichokes and asiago cheese it was not unlike a grownup hot pocketone that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer and adopted a healthier lifestyle  the quiche was pushed aside but later finished  out of hunger alone food however is an afterthought at the mascot  from what i saw the people of parkdale go for the coffee and rightly so  there was a steady stream of people coming and going and judging by the interactions quite a few regulars  with friendly laidback staff good ambience and amazing lattes i would make it my local too  if only i lived anywhere near itfootnote  seating doubles in the warmer months when its comfortable enough to sit on the driftwood looking bench that runs the length of their storefront  another good place to do some people watching
8Jw4NUzEWzHnNu4-Z2QRiA 5 utopia cafe and grill is aptly named let me tell you why one hot and muggy saturday evening i found myself walking down college street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst now im notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options and college street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants i passed by bistro after restaurant after lounge growing hungrier by the minute how did i choose divine intervention lent me a helping hand as the sky opened up and let loose a torrential downpour sending me running into the open arms see doorway of utopiait was already jam packed which had nothing to do with the rain there was a lineup for tables but i managed to grab a seat at the bar to peruse both the menu and the environment what is it about exposed brick and hardwood floors that make a place so cozy whatever it is utopia has bothneedless to say i was immediately enamoured and when i opened the menu that bubble remained intact now i wouldnt call myself a vegetarian nor would i dive into a steak with gusto so for a selectavarian such as myself i couldnt have designed a more heavenly menu if i tried all but three of their appetizers are meat free and they allow you to substitute soy grilled or breaded  fried for meat in most of their main dishes meat lovers and vegetarians uniteand if that wasnt enough it gets even better i forgot to mention earlier that in between appreciating the exposed brick and opening the menu i honed in on the beer selection tunnel vision at its finest and it made me smile for they had klb raspberry wheat on tap typically i like my beer to taste like wellbeer but i make an exception for klb especially in the summertime although i find excuses to drink it at other points in the year as the natural raspberry essence paired with the beer itself is possibly the most refreshing combination ever like angels dancing on my tonguedelicious raspberry angels its difficult to find on tap and utopia has it so i chalk them up some more pointsi started with the mumahari dip roasted red peppers pomegranate molasses and walnuts that comes served with naan while the dip itself wasnt exactly visually appealing but really how many dips are with a likening to cat food i was willing to overlook it the everlasting gobstopper of dips every bite of the mumahari started sweet moved onto nutty and finished with a bit of a kick delishbetween the dip and the klb i was already very satisfied but i wasnt done yet next came my grilled veggie  goat cheese burrito i love a good burrito and this one didnt disappoint grilled zucchini red peppers eggplant onions and a generous layer of goat cheese came wrapped in a soft tortilla served alongside substantial sides of both garden salad and rice i couldnt finish it if i triedand i tried there is absolutely nothing wrong with leftovers though and i can vouch that a utopia burrito tastes just as delicious the day afteron a tight budget all of utopias mains hover around the 13 mark which in my opinion is a great deal considering the quality of the food and the very sizeable portions i can easily see two people splitting a burrito and leaving the place with full stomachs and wallets the only problem with this scenario however is the lack of leftoversif utopia has any drawbacks its that the place is hot in the summer  really really hot the lack of airconditioning combined with the open kitchen may have something to do with it if i were anywhere else i just may have been uncomfortable but i had my pint of klb exposed brick and a smiling bartender that made me feel like i was the only person in the room okaynow im just getting carried away but that being said the service is genuinely warm looking around even though everyone had a sheen to them nobody seemed to mind everybody just looked happy people dont sweat at utopiathey glowfor a pastaheavy neighbourhood utopia provides a nice deviation its the kind of place i could eat at everyday so its probably a good thing i dont live nearby but it will definitely be my college street goto they also have a four season patio another good reason i dont live in the area as much to my livers chagrin i have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outsideutopia is a contradiction unto itself its frenetic but its calm blazers sit next to longboarders meat lovers coexist amongst vegetarians its hot but oh so cool as its name implies this bohemian spot in little italy is truly ideal
R3vvcOvLY2q0FhAlzLQqhg 5 beautifully modern and discerning nota bene provides the perfect setting for special occasions and casual dining alike what makes the experience at nota bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous and still attract a devoted clienteleyou might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary all in the same place the price is accessible the quality of the food impeccable and the service instant without being overwhelmingwe started the evening with chef davids lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials the lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell with a chipotle cream veggies and cilantro 8 they tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city and not at all heavy the lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food  the margaritas were phenomenal served on the rocks with avion tequila we tried a couple of the cocktails and loved chef davids traditional margarita with smoked sea salt the blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered anotherfor appetizers we started with the hamachi ceviche which is a yellowtail pacific fish infused with coriander lime avocado and jalapeo 16 this dish came highly recommended by our server and was absolutely worth the hype the jalapeos offered a very spicy take on the dish tempered by the avocado and limenext we tried the cavatelli pasta with a trufflescented mushroom bolognese 16 this dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it and the truffle mushrooms were divine we also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews 15 and although i am selfadmittedly duck averse i am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companionfor our mains we ordered two nota bene favourites i went with the wild digby sea scallops with avocado pure thai curry paste mango papaya and peanut salad 28 for such a tropical sounding dish the scallops actually had a very canadian east coast feel to them the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops nota bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood and i would absolutely come back for this dish againwe also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle pickled red onions queso aejo and coriander 29 the short ribs were tender succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso aejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion they were layered with flavour and flat out deliciouswith dinner we ordered a glass of ontario pinot noir and an argentinean malbec the wine list at nota bene is extensive with the full spectrum of bottles ranging from the 70 to several hundredfor dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding 12 and smore ice cream 10 needless to say the sampling turned into finishing both desserts were exploding with flavour the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream taken with a strong espresso this is dessert to die for the smore ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite with a chocolate and graham cracker crumblego try nota bene twice  once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts service quality and ambience are all top rate yet you still feel the passion nota bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guestssee you there
o3cfKu_O1n8CiJpFdjVvsA 3 geez i just cant figure it out ive been looking through what other people have said about megas and its all so badreally bad thats where the trouble comes in for me because i certainly didnt hate it as much as everyone else seems to in fact i actually thought i was going to be giving megas more then 3 stars with this review why this is the second time ive been to megas i was only going again because it was so good the first time but the second time wasnt even a close secondthe big plus megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the danforth its probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street its a big covered space thats chock full of people and at first glance is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day once you get over the patio though and it comes to eating youre likely to be disappointed but its completely dependent on what you order and when you order it the food at megas is mostly mediocre but there are a couple things worth mentioning while the rice is of the reheated overcooked slightly warmed kind the saganaki fried feta cheese made of sheeps milk and taramosalata cod caviar spread is probably some of the best on the danforth seriously if you have never tried either of these this is the place to do it but everything else order with caution this place is completely hit or miss mostly depending on how busy they arethe inside is sorta your typical greek place fake roman statues stone pillars and lots of greenery its a big space too if you check it out on the weekend chances are that big space will have more than one big group which megas can provide for comfortably but thats where most of their issues lie while they may be able to provide for big groups its at the sacrifice of all the other tables once megas gets busy the service food quality and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floorunfortunately the one thing that is truly consistent at megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation while most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate i dont blame megas for that after all thats pretty much a standard for greek food it never seems to be about the presentation when it comes to greek food theres never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table you order calamari its probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil you order hummus its probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone kalmata olive the only difference varying from place to place is whether its tasty enough to be worth eatingim still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not i mean theyve got a few things going for them like i said the first time was pretty good and if i knew i was guaranteed that every time id have no problems returning  megas basically comes down to this if the place isnt busy stop in and check it out if they are busy keep walking
vNSWdL5NLefDGdSCMrmTTw 3 once upon a time i was a university student  without giving you an exact number of how many years its been i will tell you that gap wanted everyone in khakis pagers werent quite obsolete and mambo 5 was tearing up the charts  so thankfully a lot has changed but two things remain and will always remain the same about student life  number one  students are broke  number two  they are hungry  say cheese is going to make many u of t students very happy i havent met a grilled cheese sandwich i didnt like and i havent met anyone that doesnt like a grilled cheese sandwich  that might be why so many gourmet grilled cheese places are popping up these days but its a risky business  the people have spoken and they want grilled cheese sammiesbut they dont want to pay a lot for them  after all you can make a perfectly good one at home with white bread and cheese thats more plastic than it is dairy  and thats where say cheese comes in  nigel koo part owner and operator wants to satisfy stomachs without putting a dent in wallets  he doesnt see why he cant serve up a high quality sandwich at a lowish cost and have customers walking out in a lactose induced ecstasyit was quiet when i arrived but word wasnt really out yet and the boys were still experimenting in their test kitchen  i was happy to be a guinea pig  i asked to try their most popular meat and veggie options and this is what followed  i started with indiras pulled pork made with beemster  diners can choose to have regular cheese such as cheddar on their sandwich 650 or upgrade to a premium choice 850 my creation came topped with homemade mac  cheese fun on whole wheat bread  i only ate half as i had more coming my way but the sandwiches here are generous and i had to pace myself  the different textures paired nicely but i would have liked it more had the meat been a touch saucier or came with something in which to dip itnext came the italian classic  not that im taking bets but if you put buffalo mozzarella on anything i will eat it  so i was pleased when they said one of their best meatless sellers was filled with the stuff  i like a good margharita pizza and this was the sandwich version  as if that wasnt enough and by all dietary standards it was more than that i was offered their dessert sandwich  it didnt take a lot of prodding and went something like this nigel  you should try our dessert option  me  wow i dont know  im really stuffed  okaythe french grilled toast is like a mnage a trois between a grilled cheese some french toast and a piece of cheesecake its good  scary good  filled with ricotta mascarpone and a berry compote the sandwich is then dusted with turbinado sugar and drizzled with maple syrup  as with french toast this needed to be eaten with a knife and fork which probably worked in my best interest as it stopped me from inhaling it  i will be going back for this one  as it is now i think about it more than anyone should think about a sandwichso in total i ended up eating just a little bit more than a full sandwich thanks to the few bites i had of the french toast and i was beyond full  so much so that i actually skipped dinner that night now by my calculations that equals two meals for the price of one and a low price at that this bodes well for hungry students up to their necks in debt  footnote  during the week for a mere thirty minutes between 420 and 450 you can get yourself a sandwich and side including soup salad and possible ramen for just 420
BqMTHIJ_S5aT3Mt1fWT_pg 3 as im writing this i already know a lot of people are going to disagree with me after all the arrival of littlefish in the junction has definitely been well received the neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool hipsterworthy brunch spot unfortunately the arrival of littlefish hasnt completely filled that void just yet they still have a few kinks to work out but dont give up on them yet i wont but only because i really want to love itok first off this is a pretty cool restaurant besides the obviously brilliant name littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch its small only about 8 tables or so but that just makes it allthemore cozier and comfortable its a long narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts the daily specials scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard are imaginative original and wellthoughtoutthe brunch menu is pretty much what youd expect to see they have everything from french toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes best of all they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredientsthe staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable constantly being checked on i never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee but i suppose thats sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 peoplethe thing thats not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food when i was there it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive i know i definitely did if they were understaffed i couldnt understand it there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency definitely not understaffed here the whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos the front counter was covered with papers and dishes and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces organized chaos but just barely containedpeople rave about the food here but i really dont see it my eggs benny was meh ok but they certainly werent anything to get excited about they were warm but not hot and the side of potatoes was mostly burned my daughter had their now internet famous french toast with burned edges on an overcrowded plate they were even less than mehmake no mistake though this place was busy newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates but they are offered coffee if youre planning on getting a table on the weekend be prepared to wait so why so busy personally i think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhoods lack of options id be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the junction had they been on a more brunch heavy area like west queen west they may not be doing as well as they are nowso would i go back to littlefish sure id like to give them another chance i think the whole neighbourhood would after all the junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the junction
8xhfrLJ9SGpX2NU6FTiTHA 3 im a sucker for topnotch pizza by topnotch i mean pizza that is served sizzling and fresh and made with highquality ingredients pizza like that is true craftsmanship pizza like that i could eat every day in my continuing effort to find superior pizza i looked to lil baci in leslieville my visit didnt disappoint melil bacis dining room is a decentsized dining space but the tables are packed pretty tight so dont expect too much privacy youll likely hear everything that the table next to you is talking about if you need to escape your neighbour table in the warmer months you may want to check out the cute backyard patio comfortable busy and social its the place to be when the sun is outwhen im eating italian food i like to start off with a glass of red vino or cold italian beer lil bacis wine list is small but thorough and their beer list offers some nice italian choices moretti and perroni are my personal favouriteslil baci has a seriously amazing dandelion greens salad  if youve never had dandelions as food before this would be the one to expose yourself to it the greens are slightly bitter but the bitterness works well topped with shaved parmigiano cracked black pepper and freshly squeezed lemon perfect starterand the pizza they do it right lil baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their quattro fromagi my personal favorite  theyve got some other really outstanding pizzas to choose from like the margherita with tomato basil and mozza the lil baci with pecorino sausage and fennel pollen and the gorgonzola dolce with gorgonzola yukon gold potatoes and caramelized onions all of their pizzas are served on signature thin crust dough that is seared and blistered perfectlylil baci has got a really small pasta menu ridiculously small theres only three items but still these 3 items are done perfectly theyre all made with quality ingredients and use that great tomato sauce thats on the pizza my favorite is just the plain ole spaghetti and meatballs  its got just the right amount of fresh basil sauce and parmigiano the portion size isnt huge but with that dandelion salad and something from their insalata menu its more than enoughlil baci also has a panino menu which surprisingly is different from their pizza menu i love the panino tonnato packed with italian tuna caper aioli sundried tomatoes and arugula its perfectly pressed into an amazing bitethe dessert menu has a few options but when i was there i had a lemon prosecco tart the crust was buttery but a tad on the dry side the custardlike lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour which balanced the acidity nicelyi head to lil baci when i want some decently priced italian food and some amazing pizza lunch or dinner what you end up with is a steal anywhere in the city
6kDLjGNr7SzoUTwhwTazBA 3 i was here the other day for lunch and as expected there was a bit of a line  thats usually a good sign and in this case its definitely true but waiting for a table isnt all bad theres lots to see in this place kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood when i was there the place was cramped and full of hungry people but everyone was in good spirits when i look at the menu i always find it difficult to make a choice theyve got a big diverse menu with both savory and sweet items all of it looks delicious  first off im a vegetarian but like to get the breakfast pocket sans pemeal bacon of course  its chock full of fluffy eggs caramelized onions mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun aunties and uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides but ive never chose anything but the potato salad seriously this stuff is good a great combo of chunky red potatoes dill dijon and spices its savoury and creamy admittedly my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive so if you go dont go when youre in a hurryfruit juices and iced teas are good choices but i wouldnt finish off with an espresso as they may suggest their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak and it certainly doesnt stand up to manic coffee located just a few doors down if youre craving an aftermealcaffienefix id suggest you head over to manicaunties and uncles loses points in service the service staff seem a bit cold sorta aloof and alot grouchy but despite if youre willing to overlook that then this is worth a visit if youre in the college  bathurst area
-NFqTYMVwBYNEL8Q9dGVSA 1 meh youd think that there wouldnt be much to be said about greasy mexican food but that doesnt seem to be true in la haciendas case not on my part though theyve got a pretty decent reputation online particularly where weekend brunch is concerned the internet is full of lots of reviews lots of checkins and lots of positive feedbackid say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong la hacienda is a decent little place at first walkin cozy dimly lit the kinda place youd expect to find on this stretch of queen west with a mostlycovered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery it seems like the perfect place to hide on a sunday afternoonbut one thing is for sure it isnt the perfect place to eat the menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what youll be eating mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa but again that salsa isnt made with any degree of love or passion for food just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning la hacienda sure doesnt have the freshchopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole youd expect of a mexican joint this place doesnt have one dam authentic thing about it perfect for a hot sunday afternoon they also serve inhouse made sangrias by the glass or pitcher unfortunately theyre far from perfect too cheap red wine mixed with prefrozen orange juice and few bits of floating fruit its again a big miss from the freshness most people associate with sangrias call me crazy but for 6 bucks a glass i want some freshsqueezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose i want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus not just whatever is laying around and recently openedon this particular day la hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook hardly enough to accommodate the backpatio alone nevermind the front of the place while still friendly the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy never returning to check on how people liked their food which i assume they didnt she was so busy in fact that i didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completelyseriously this place is should be on your avoid list there is absolutely nothing special or mexican for that matter about it at all its just greasy overpriced mexican themed food served in a hipster shop on queen west if youre looking for authenticity youve got a ton of other waybetter options in this city
2_kKYvQF9dgUXsaqQGsu7A 3 the story goes according to the murrays sandwich emporium website that murray is a weiner dog who loves the finer things in life despite the obvious assumptions murray does not take kindly to eating regular old hot dogs he prefers a more delectable refined meal what does murray like the most sandwiches of course in fact he loves them so much that he  used all of his love and expertise to build a sandwich shop for his fellow sandwich lovers thus murrays sandwich emporium sprang to lifei recently found myself in the exact same conundrum as murray the dog was i was sick of my sameolsameol packed lunches and i was searching for something better i know youre thinking that sandwiches have to be the most clich lunch choice of them all but one look at murrays menu and youll know that youre in for something much different there is not a huge selection by sheer number at murrays but each item is unique and there is a decent range of combinations across the board there are meatless chicken beef fish cheese and even sweet sandwiches plus a decent offering of sides note combos and sides are extra the restaurant itself is pretty simplistic its small has exposed and undecorated brick walls and two large wooden tables with stools scattered around them the chalkboard menu hangs on the wall and there is a small refrigerator full of beverages just off to the side it is all very subdued and quite appropriate for a sandwich shopi held back a bit on my first trip to murrays i didnt really know what to expect how big the servings would be and what kind of value i would find there i decided to go with the uncle phil sliced ribeye onions green peppers and ooey gooey messy melty provolone cheese on a beautiful baguette truthfully i thought the bread was the best part of this sandwich i dont feel bad for discounting the meat or toppings because for sandwiches at least the bread is just as much a star in the meal as anything else the baguette was clearly very fresh they keep it tender but crispy and most importantly not over or understuffed the meat was tender too but it needed a bit more oomph the green peppers were just slightly sauted giving them a nice crunch and as mentioned above the cheese was gloriously gooey all of that was topped off with a pickle  for nine bucksi felt that i didnt really get the whole experience of murrays my first time around so on my second visit i decided to get into some side dishes i certainly didnt hold back on my sandwich choice with the bltizzy  double smoked b of course some l and t housemade mayo avocado and an egg a 100 addon i threw all of that into a combo with some onion rings and a can of pop bringing my total to 12 plus tax this is a bit pricey in my opinion but considering the amount of food they give you its not so bad here again i thought the bread stood out more than anything else it was so fresh and tasted of near perfection just like the uncle phil the fillings were good but other than the sheer volume they were fairly regulartasty but regularoverall murrays sandwich emporium offers a delicious product that is definitely oversized and that will satisfy your hunger plus theyre open for lunch dinner and latenight eats however as tasty as the sandwiches are i cant say anything really blew me away yes the menu item names are unique and fun and the serving sizes are huge but nothing is really over the top that being said sometimes simple is best they know what theyre good at they know how to make a good sandwich and theyre consistent good boy murray
zNu5ytMhNJ9N70AF04X9rg 5 i am in lovehow do i know i paid 22 for a burger lunch and am absolutely ok with itgrindhouse is serious carnivore territorythe first thing to stand out though was my drink i went for my usual diet cola and i got sorry we dont have anything with aspartame in fact you shouldnt go there expecting to get your goto big brand soft drink at all well well well i better go for something really interesting then boylans birch beer  a root beer drink sweetened with cane sugar with pure vanilla extract and only one preservative sodium benzoate typically used in soft drinks and other acidic preserves their amazing dedication to fresh and natural ingredients obviously did not end thereall of the ingredients are local and fresh the burger meat comes from naturally raised livestock and is genetically modified organism hormone and antibioticfree you will not find anything that has refined sugars or artificial sweeteners hence the lack of cocacola and pepsi on the premises they literally prepare everything inhouse the buns are made there and they also make the ketchup and mustard themselves right in the back kitchen the fresh and never frozen attitude is not good enough here if youre going to do it do it righttheir burger creations are unique and creative a turkey burger with black truffles and cranberries yes they do have a veggie burger and its soyfree and my choice the black and blue burger are just a few of the menu items i was presented with a cajun spiced beef patty smothered in blue cheese sauce and cooked only to medium with a side of onion rings who was i kidding with that diet cola anywayif you can be sure of the meat quality requesting a burger cooked less than welldone will give you much more flavour and a better texture on my first bite there was an immediate rush of barbecue charcoal flavour emanating from the patty it tasted like summertime the blue cheese sauce was mild and considering the cajun description it was spiced not spicy the onion rings were huge and somehow satisfyingly greasy but unbelievably crispyi actually dont often talk about presentation because frankly its all about the taste for me i have eaten enough beautiful yet disappointing and ugly yet amazing dishes to spend much time considering plating however the simple beauty of this burger and onion rings dish was lovely  just a white plate and a burger without a toothpickedpickle piercing the bun lovelymuch like my university professors i hesitate to give out a perfect score and i cant on good conscious say that this was the very best burger in the city but  a big but  they gave me something pretty darn close to the best burger around and the attention paid to good fresh and healthful ingredients truly impressed metheir name might be harsh and gory but youll find burgerfare inside that is gentle and kind to you and your body

nauqE-2FDrcfjGinmGA9Xg 3 cupcakes have reached a point of utmost popularity in the world of baked goods why are people flocking to these brightly coloured frosted palmsized desserts well im sure there is some greater social commentary to be made here about a reversion to childhood or a need for comfort foods in our overstressed overworked lives but in the case of prairie girl bakery its just simply that they taste so darn goodwalking into prairie girl bakery is almost like entering a fine clothing store  everything is placed just so the whole space is pristinely clean and clear of clutter literally nothing exists except a counter and backwall display the cupcakes are kept safely behind the employees lined up row by row waiting to be selected and boxed up all of the focus is on their one and only product there is no time wasted on brewing coffee serving tea or making sandwiches everything comes down to one thing the cake and the icingwhen i first walked into the store i thought i made a mistake i went in to grab a dozen cupcakes for a work function and was shocked at the lack of merchandise on the shelves i had to ask was i supposed to preorder before coming in not at all they just take extra care to provide the freshest product possible promising never to serve a dayold cupcake so baking in big batches to keep the shelves stocked to the brim all day is out of the question the team at prairie girl bakery prides itself on being resourceful and limiting waste they even take any leftover cupcakes to a local charitable organization torontos second harvest that is dedicated to providing realistic solutions to hunger are cupcakes a necessity for a charitable food organization of course not but why not give where you can and provide something a bit more luxurious than canned food to those in needthe cupcakes come in two sizes 13 flavours and an array of beautiful colours you wont find any unneeded extras here like inedible sugar flower toppings disguising an otherwise delectable treat the cakes are simple and the swirls of icing are in the spotlight on top of light bases the range of flavours include peanut butter banana red velvet with classic cream cheese icing chocolatechocolate chocolatevanilla chocolatehazelnut chocolate cake with peppermint icing and my ultimate favourite chocolate cake with strawberry icing the strawberry colour was fairly mute but the flavour was intense even more impressive was that the chocolate cake didnt overpower the icing or vice versa each deep flavour perfectly complemented the othera dozen minicupcakes come in at 1895 and one dozen regular size at 3195 my gluttonous side will only order the mini cupcakes from now on allowing me to eat two or three different flavours in one sitting however there is something supremely gorgeous about the sight of one of their regular sized cupcakes sitting in its very own container complete with viewing window waiting only for youwant to feel a little less guilty about completely indulging in these sinfully tasty treats prairie girl bakerys dedication to remaining as allnatural as possible streams throughout the whole operation not only do they use recyclable cardboard packaging but they are absolutely free of preservatives artificial flavours and hydrogenated or trans fats id say thats mostly healthy eatingon one final note i have to say that i love the mythology around this place the story is that prairie girl bakerys creator jean blacklock learned all she knew from her family back on her saskatchewan farm she eventually left a career in law to bring that down home prairie old fashioned baking to us citydwellers i dont think there could possibly be more charm or more beauty in the simplicity of what prairie girl bakery is and what they produce

En1MNI1OIEBxvAAmmWjQMg 3 if the word bulk conjers up images of dusty old ethnic shop food bins or soulless bulk barns then you need to check out nuthouse for a second opinion sitting in a little space out in the bloor and lansdowne nuthouse has established itself with blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting productsfirst thing youll notice about nuthouse is that it smells goodit smells really goodit smells like an incredibly nice mix of highquality nuts cereals grains teas dried fruit lentils dried fruit spices cake and coffee its a smell that right away makes you feel comfortable and assures you that what youre getting is filled with quality dont expect to see the typical bulk fare with hundreds of bins full of overly processed and massproduced stuff youre in the wrong place for that sorta thing nuthouse is full of nothing but always high quality and sometimes organic productsok that might not be the very first thing you notice chances are if youre walking down bloor looking for this place or even if youre not looking for it the first thing youll notice wont even be inside the store itll be the big plastic walnut hanging above the front doorway that big walnut has become somewhat of a landmark item on this stretch of bloor even though theyve only been in business for a few monthsnuthouse isnt just about nuts they carry all sorts of things from organic candy and fairtrade coffee to raw cereals and handmade soap and its healthy too a lot of the stuff they carry is the sugarfree vegan raw organic type of stuff which makes it a super option for more health conscious people and if you have dietary restrictions nuthouse has got you covered too with tons of gluten and wheat free products like their spiced carrot cake if thats your bag and you live in the area you no longer need to travel far to get these kinda thingspersonally when i think of organic or locallysourced or handmade or any other related adjective used to describe stuff in a store like this i unfortunately also think expensive at nuthouse though that really isnt the case the prices are actually fairly downtoearth and mostly afforable in fact a lot of the products they sell are actually cheaper than the bulk stuff you find at no frills with an obvious element of quality you may not find at bigger places wanting to try out interesting varieties of stuff you already love like lentils or rice or yes even nuts nuthouse has got you covered they carry a ton of different kinds some of which you probably didnt even know existed and that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something buying in bulk doesnt have to be about being able to get more for less its about being able to also get well just less the fact that nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake
PyGsrZ-TA0-cN53skFNTxw 1 walk in to famosos new annex location and there is no mistaking the kind of restaurant you have entered a popular loud hang out for students families and friends alike its a casual place with daily deals movies cheap wine on wednesdays etc tvs showing blue jays games and young staff working feverishly to keep up with the sitin and takeout clientele  its got a pleasant relaxed vibe and people seemed to be rather enjoying themselvesonce seated in our booth we perused the menu and our lovely server explained how the restaurant works you write down your order on the notepad provided bring it up to the counter and hand it in you can either pay right away or begin a tab any subsequent orders can be placed through the wait staff i assume this method is effective for those in a hurry but it did seem a little odd considering how often our server checked in on us she also expounded upon the red sauce pizzas made with campania tomato sauce fiordelatte mozzarella basil and pecorino romano cheese the white saucepizzas are made with a garlic and olive oil sauce instead of the tomatoeswe opted for the prosciuttowrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer the funghi tartufo and san andreas pizzas and for dessert the dolce and banana dish as with any selfrespecting pizza place they had san pellegrino on the menu so got an aranciata my fave and a limonata my dining companion kindly took the order the counter while i scoped out the huge place before me famoso has really nice exposed brick walls comfortable booths and by my count at least three staff members per table there are a lot of eyes on tables and not much gets missed the staff is universally nice if perhaps inexperienced it lacked a certain finesse but made up for it in sweet charmour appetizer arrived and im glad we asked for salt pepper and chili flakes the mozzarella balls were tasty but the red sauce which would appear later on our funghi pizza was very very sweet for my liking too sweet  a dash of salt and some chili flakes were necessary and helped considerably i was hoping for crispier prosciutto too as a start to the meal it was pretty average if youre going to get an appetizer i would recommend you try a salad they looked fresh and tastyour funghi  tartufo pizza arrived fairly shortly afterward it consisted of roasted white mushrooms oyster mushrooms truffle oil and parmiggiano reggiano  again it was better with the salt and chili flakes  the crusts at famoso are a bit thicker than is the trend right now but i liked the chewier texture i only wish that this pizza had been left in the 900degree oven a little longer as it needed a little more crispiness to counter the soft melting cheese that was starting to soak through the crust a note i took a slice of this one home and had it two days later i have to say it tasted much better as a leftoverour second pizza  the san andreas  was a new world pizza with a white sauce chililime marinated chicken and fresh mozzarella it was then baked and topped with avocado slices diced roma tomatoes onion cilantro a drizzle of cream and a lime wedge certainly not traditional but pretty darned tasty the pizza seemed to have stayed in the oven just that little bit longer and had that nice char on the bottom the lime juice provided a bright flavour and the chicken was tender id have liked a little more chicken but thats a bit of a nitpick it was a good pizza were i to go back i would steer my companions toward it if they wanted to try something a little differentfinally dessert this was my favourite dish of the four we tried a long rectangular plate of roasted bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar topped with pecans and caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream in the middle arrived at the table and my eyes widened this looked and smelled fantasti and tasted even better the bananas were piping hot and creamy and contrasted beautifully with the crunch of the sugar and the chill of the ice cream that dish was devoured in what had to be record timeoverall famoso isfine there isnt anything in particular that stands out but there isnt anything egregiously wrong with it either  it caters to a wide variety of tastes so it is sure to be a good option if you are going out with a group with varying tastes or dietary restrictions or preferences do not bother with the prosciuttowrapped mozzarella balls but do not skip dessert

XC9yT_qCACdgsyLhWOjR6A 1 la revolucion is amazing well no it isnt but thats exactly how i wanted to start this off man i really wanted to love this place la revolucion just looks so dam cool that i figured the whole experience was going to be amazing when i was first drawn by the interesting front stainedglass window and poked my head inside to look around i figured that in notimeatall thered be a lineup to get in sadly i dont think thats going to be the case anytime soonla revolucion is a mexican restaurant but at first glance it certainly doesnt scream mexican after eating there im not even sure thats what theyre going for its a sparsely decorated joint that for some reasonat least while i was therefeels the need to distance themselves even more from their mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music i mean their food is the typical standard mexican fare youd expect like enchiladas and tacos and burritos but other than that and the few mexicanesque decorations there wasnt much mexican about it at alltheyre heavily pushing the banditos aspect of mexican culture which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes while i get the whole concept of banditos and revolution it seemed as though la revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme while what little decor they have there is mostly banditorelated the rest of the theme is left to interpretation la revolucion does feel as though theyre finding their identity but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests sitting there it doesnt feel as though you were part of the revolution it feels as though youre interrupting them while they plan it and they cant wait for you to leave so they can get back down to businesspresentation isnt their strong point either they haphazardly slap the food down on the plate without much concern for appearances my enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa my burrito was humungous but it was bland and not nearly warm enough when i asked for hot sauce because it was nowhere to be found i got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce but its details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server and while youre waiting for that stuff to all arrive theres no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter which would have definitely improved the experienceinterestingly enough before this place was a mexican place it was well a mexican place whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand and while that may have been a great idea on their part the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because its hard to tell exactly what the concept is la revolucion may be a restaurant but a revolution it is not
vl_fNpZEXn30gWc8Aj2CJA 3 the rotisserie house is a familyrun portuguese barbeque or churrasqueira restaurant in the liberty village area like most places owned and run by families this restaurant is small a bit cluttered with a mishmash of dcor and no matter the number of other patrons there at the time has a staff that makes you feel like the centre of attentionthey happen to be closed on the weekend but from monday to thursday they are open from 1100 am to 730 pm and fridays from 1100 am to 830 pm the hours are slightly odd but it makes for a great lunch spot especially for those like me who tend to take lunch anytime between about noon and 300 pmthey offer a variety of chicken dishes a number of different sides and even one vegetarian option you can get a 14 or 12 rotisserie chicken dinner  white meat or dark meat  with a choice of two small sides for 650  1000 for an additional 099 small or 198 double you can get a side of onion rings greek or caesar saladthe menu itself is pretty huge and is filled with quite a few options the regular roster of sides for example includes portuguese rice roasted parisian potatoes steamed vegetables french fries garden salad or potato wedges mains include the abovementioned chicken combos rib combos a variety of salads and soups chicken wings and fingers and sandwiches like pulled chicken grilled vegetable grilled chicken pork or sausage they even offer cateringi decided upon the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of parisian potatoes the pulled chicken is topped with their famous hot sauce served on a white or whole wheat kaiser and is dressed with mayo lettuce and tomato all of this with a drink came in at about 9one of my alltime favourite side dishes are those lemony roasted potatoes available at most greek restaurants well the rotisserie houses parisian roasted potatoes are a close second they are red probably from paprika and just a bit fiery from the restaurants signature hot sauce the pulled chicken sandwich was flavourful tender and also had the same red hue from the saucei do enjoy spicy foods though i am a bit of a wimp this restaurants hot sauce had a great kick and a good flavour but it wont burn your mouth to the point that you cant taste anything else this is really important since they throw the hot sauce on their dishes whether its requested or not dont fret too much about all the spice if youre grabbing lunch and heading back to the office you can buy a pack of gum here tooconsidering the size of this restaurant i was quite surprised by the number of items they have on the menu it was not overly busy when i walked in so everything went very smoothly as far as timing and service went the staff is extremely friendly but very small so i am curious to see what happens when it gets really busy however they seem to have it all figured outif i lived closer to liberty village i could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch or to grab some dinner on the way home from work the prices are reasonable the food tastes good and its quick and satisfying
fDOAUUMS9KY4NBPI_XArjQ 3 the most common praise of dark horse is its patio the most common complaint about dark horse is its lack of service on the patioif youve been to bloor west village you know that there arent a lot of patios in the neighbourhood and any patio that you do find is likely going to be small cramped and full of people with the exception of the firkin on runnymede dark horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints people watch or eat burgers and friesbut as many people have pointed out before me the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when youre sitting out there while youre waiting you may even be waiting so long for service that youll feel compelled to go inside and get your own drinks which causes the server to give you attitude when she eventually gets to your table which causes you to feel uncomfortable you see the vicious circle taking shape hereallinall the food at dark horse isnt half bad granted they arent going to win any awards anytime soon but for pub food that goes well with a few drinks its pretty decent while some of the food like the calamari and nachos is previously frozen and highly unimaginative other items like their village burger or fish and chips are clearly made inhouse and truly tasty they also serve a weekend brunch that is worth checking out but expect to wait for a table it fills up quickly with the neighbourhood localsall of the expected draft options are herei think truthbetold the server never actually rattled off the draft list to us in the limited time she spent at our table luckily there were a few beerbranded signs in the patio which makes the process a little easier but a lot less convenientdark horses problems are easily fixable they just need a bit more staff trust me sit back on the patio have a pint and watch them work itll quickly become obvious that theyre understaffed another server or two during their busier times and dark horse could be fantastictruth be told its just a pub and a fairly average one at that if youre in a hurry you may want to avoid this place but if youve got some time to kill and want to soak up some sun on a patio dark horse provides nicely
cRJcKF3fQCUDjX69daVTzA 1 located in the annex in the middle of mirvish village the central is a bar a restaurant and a live music venue  the dimly lit houseturnedrestaurant with the splendidly seamy vibe immediately and completely tugged at my heart strings  i loved the rickety setting and little details like the draught use your eyes sign behind the barbut as with any new love first impressions can often deceive you the central played with my emotions  the menu  and be warned the online menu is not what you will find when you arrive there  has so much potential and i very much wanted the food to live up to my expectations  my party of three shared grilled calamari with side of salad greens in a light citrus dressing followed by entrees of grilled mushroom salad with shrimp a grilled vegetable sandwich with sweet potato fries and a cheesesteak sandwich with tom yum soup all of which with three beers came in at just over 60the menu items are not very risky but still need to be done carefully to be successful  as much as i wanted everything to come out perfectly it simply did not  first of all the calamari was a very large serving  so far so good  but in grilling it whole the tips became overcooked and the centre remained undercooked and there was a hint of burnt charcoal flavour  the grilled vegetables were also overcooked producing an allover brown hue making them completely lose their individuality  the cheesesteak had the right flavour but again the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy  finally after looking forward to trying one of the desserts in hopes for menuredemption like the candied strawberries or the everinfamous deep fried mars bars we were told that all they had available was ice cream  not so impressivewhile the main dishes and lack of desserts were disappointing i do have to commend them on a couple of things  all of the side dishes were onpoint the dressing on both the calamari dish and the mushroom salad were light flavourful and had a good citrus tang the sweet potato fries were crispy and came with a side of a creamy cinnamon dip that was a great alternative to regular ketchup and the tom yum soup was hot spicy and a great choice for a chilly december nighti have decided that the central could very well become a favourite spot of mine for drinks and maybe appetizers but is just not an ideal choice for a full dinner  the venue itself is one that you should check out and i expect it is only better when the patio is open in the summer  if you dont want to sit in the main bar to listen to the band they have a cozy lounge space upstairs that can be rented for private parties  also they clearly take pride in the beverage menu especially the beer choices  when we had some trouble deciding on a pint we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called netherworld a flying monkey brew which is similar to the popular mill st tankhouse alei give them an a for atmosphere but only a gold starforeffort on the menu
Mk_ZW9-ol4mFr9HMvjQmiQ 3 wanting to try something new and looking for a cool place to go for preyukyuks dinner and drinks my friend and i decided to try out everest restaurant on queen westwhat seemed to be a quiet saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm quickly turned into a fairly busy club like dining experience and everest is certainly dressed to impress the restaurant feels both sexy and modern with dark mood lighting clean lines comfortable and cozy booth seating and an eclectic playlistdj depending on what night you are in with a great view of queen west for people watching and muchmusic across the street the atmosphere music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the localsi was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks and hoping to find a new goto place for a fun and creative meal i secured reservations before our arrival however we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception waved to an area in the front of the room and told i could sit wherever i wanted unorthodox maybe but sit we didputting the hostesses indifference behind us we decided to delve straight into the wine menu and with a little help from our server selected the beringer cabernet sauvignon knights valley a california vintage from 2009 for about 40 the wine was excellent and i found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the listthe dinner menu 1520 presents a somewhat more challenging predicament filled with tibetan and indian dishes along side the same old north american standby of pasta and sandwiches i found myself unsure if this was a tibetan restaurant or your average italian eatery all dressed up its not that i mind an eclectic menu in fact i appreciate one however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine in this case tibetan one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft and have their specialty cuisine down pat thus i was unsure of whether venturing into the momas tibetan dumplings and shamomo spinach and beef or the fettuccine alfredo was the better optionafter some quality deliberation between the tibetnorth america paradox i decided to try a platter a mix of several different tibetan style foods to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible the menu seemed heavy on potatoes stewed meats and rice so i decided to try almost all of the above the stewed potatoes were good cooked just right but tasted much like something i could make at home no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like i was trying something exotic the rice was cooked with raisins which just didnt do it for me and was a little bland  my meal was served with steamed tibetan vegetables broccoli and carrots which aside from not seeming exceptionally tibetan to me were surprisingly good an interesting side note both of our meals were served with naan bread which really was just pita bread from my estimation overall i was fairly underwhelmed by my choice my friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread same problem and said that she enjoyed her meal the butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me so that must be a good thing but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving indian food while i thoroughly enjoyed everest restaurant for its attention to the design dcor and ambience i was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into tibetan food i think the next time we decide to go out for tibetan style cuisine we will try little tibet further down queen street
kUgUo3SfZDj_XwAECQtkjQ 3 despite its seemingly religious name this blansdowne cafe has nothing to do religion its a little cafe chockfull of character and a cool homeysorta vibe you know the type of place im talking about mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables value villageesque paintings and pictures on the walls slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling it sorta looks like one day someone decided well we have a stove why dont we open a restaurant it seems random but truthfully it doesnt matter all that much if anything those details make it better and much more comfortablethere really isnt that much for food here theyve got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy which it definitely does mostly its just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing no soup no fries no salad as a side anyways the friendly guy working there told me that its not that kinda place he said that its mostly a cafe and a place to drink boozethe menu is up on a chalkboard and like i mentioned it mostly has pressed sandwiches like grilled cheese with apples and tandoori chicken stuffed naan bread the sandwiches certainly arent bad but sadly the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made inhouse like the naan bread the naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant and then bought at some grocery retail giant it definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff they do have quite a few baked goods too im not sure if those were made inhouse or not but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serveive seen some pictures of brunch items at holy oak like eggs benny but based on when i was there i couldnt see that happening maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook but they guy working never mentioned it to me when i asked him about the food or the limited menui went during the week for lunch and this little place was pretty packed mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops it seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing because there really isnt much else in the neighborhood that offers it its cozy and comfortable and i could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee comfortably typing awayholy cafe is a neat place but it certainly doesnt warrant a big trip to get to it if you happen to be in the neighborhood and youre looking for a comfortable place to soak up wifi and get a decent cup of coffee holy oak can definitely provide but it doesnt offer much more than that
yH17eZfSnECroW_OLBaJAg 3 sharkeys is no more and thank god for that i mean i know the restaurant options in bloor west village are limited but i really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did with horrible service brutal food and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers they created a place that was meant to be avoided yet somehow it managed to exist on that corner for yearsso imagine my surprise when i saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one daya few months later the kennedy public house was born and boyohboy this place is exactly what  bwv needs bwv is virtually void of restaurants serving great food ok so theres earth and dr generosity but other than that your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other toronto neighbourhoods thats why seeing something as untraditional in bwv as the kennedy is such a welcoming sightthe kennedy has a cool vibe that if you know the neighbourhood you wouldnt expect to see there it seems oddly outofplace while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there with a laboriously nice interior space the entire design is wellthought out a nice to be in but surprisingly the kennedy isnt just nice to look at it also has exceptionally good foodthe kennedys menu doesnt serve your typical pub grub its much more imaginative than that nontraditional items like polenta burgers calamari poboy sandwiches and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare like wings macaroni and cheese and thin crust pizzas their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and wellthought outworking with a number of local businesses the kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places youre probably familiar with like cobs bread and wellington county beef nice ive always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste betterone other thing worth mentioning the kennedy has unisex bathrooms and theyve incorporated them into the place really nicely except for the handdryer the bathroom handdryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire freeworld if you happen to be sitting in the backhalf of the restaurant it might even ruin your experience hopefully theyll turn to either cloth or paper towels or theyll just find one that is quieterkeep in mind though if youre looking for a relaxing experience this isnt the place with strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a montesorri school and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at john and adelaide the kennedy doesnt provide a quite and relaxing experience what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldnt expect to find in a typical public house
snwY-gb9yLeL4RSOS4QBRQ 3 as a group of new toronto recruits we decided to try out rebel house at the suggestion of one of my coworkers an easy walk from the rosedale subway stop we went the evening of the stanley cup final expecting the place to be packed but managed to find comfortable hightop seating and friendly service amidst a fairly busy nightthe rebel house is a small pub with a quaint upstairs section where we sat several tvs aired the hockey game and there was an eclectic mix of people some older into their 50s but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and studentsthe menu is varied but small although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability which is always a good betmy dining partner decided to go with the daily special mussels 14 absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce with toasted garlic bread i ordered the spicy spinach cheese pennies 10 small appetizersized cheese patties with nary a spinach leaf in sightnor were they spicey no matter these delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside gooey on the inside and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with at our servers suggestions i also ordered the spinach and apple salad 6 with cheddar cheese toasted almonds and a homemade maple dressing on the side a wonderful combination in fact we liked the cheese pennies so much we ordered another batch only to find that that a repeat order isnt always as good the second time around these pennies were so thick with grease i found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down i think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good but for now i choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the spicy spinach cheese pennies delightfulmy dining partner an adventurous drinker himself ordered a labatt blue but it did come in the extra large bottle which made him smile from ear to ear i ordered the henry of pelham pinot noir to start but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak not to be discouraged i tried the 2006 cabernet franc special reserve vqa after dinner and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine i have had at a pub in some time it had a heavy quality with a nice vanilla finish i would go back to rebel house just to try this glass of wine againour server was friendly and talkative and the prices at rebel house are fairly reasonable wine was about 78 a glass and our meals were between 812 for the appetizers and up to 20 for an entre except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies rebel house is an excellent neighbourhood pub serving up good food at good prices
IODJhNP9ENOBbu3HRDpOCw 3 i came to ultimate caf by accident in a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of hey lucy i was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini wednesday at that popular king west spot enter stageright ultimate caf a bit of entertainment district fun for you there whether coincidentally or strategically they also offer their own cheap martini wednesday  how clever their menu is fairly standard including soups nachos sandwiches and paninis pastas and salads and they say the ingredients are bought fresh daily from kensington marketafter my first meal i decided to do some reading and collect the thoughts from others before making my final decision on ultimate the reviews are mixed and i have to agree with that sentimentive now been to ultimate twice once for dinner and once for lunch the night of the martinis i decided to make a meal of appetizers  a favourite thing to do i had the spring rolls and the sweet potato and lemongrass soup i wasnt disappointed in the least the spring rolls were crunchy and hot and the soup though a tad too sweet for my own taste always a risk for sweet potato dishes was flavourful thick and rich it was a satisfying meal but much like the menu was basic stuffthen i went back for lunch we started with the nachos which turned out to be a delight they look completely unimpressive but once you dive in youll realize that there is just the right amount of melted cheese neither scorched or soggy and its topped lightly with chopped lettuce tomato olives and jalapeno i have come across some online grumbles about the portion sizes but any more and it would have proven far too big for a twoperson starter or a oneperson meal my entre was the montreal smoked meat panini with a side salad the panini was my favourite dish there by far the meat was warm and tender and again was not oversized the sandwich was obviously freshly pressed and there was a tangy mustard spread topping it off but heres the rub  the salad was small and the leaves were wilted which is a common complaint across the boards about their greens and the dressing could not possibly have been made inhouse it maybe could have passed for garnish a really topnotch side could have elevated this dish to be lunchtime excellence like the portions the prices are decent with both of my visits coming in at just around 20 per personthere is one very short footnotetype comment that i must leave you with on both occasions i was greeted by an employee whom i can only assume is the host he will nab you on the street when you stop to glance at the menu to convince you to come in and though he means well will be extremely present during your time there i cant say it was bothersome enough to warrant a phone call but i also cannot give you my recommendation without mentioning this very obvious addition to the dining experience at ultimate so i toyed with a 2star vs my decided upon 3star rating the decor is kind of cool the service was fast and courteous despite the overattentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night they offer some pretty good if not somewhat lacklustre grub with at least one amazing sandwich just doors down from the previously reviewed joe mamas king west is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me
iXp5A9Zl02oomdjHyIgVjA 3 the duke of kent serves up traditional pub food in a cozy spot at the corner of yonge and eglinton  kent is just one of a series of duke pubs scattered around toronto and judging from the fairly comprehensive website each has a slightly different dcor but all of them seem to tap into that english corner pub ambienceafter a long week at work i was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint enjoy some hearty food and catch up with some friends the duke of kent was a great choicefor the most parti snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy friday night  when we first walked in it seemed hopeless we wanted dinner but there was nary a table to be seen  the staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we werent forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area  that is what service is all about and we were happy to stay  many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping friday nightas for the food it is the expected and welcomed pub spread  they offer up fish  chips yes served in a basket on paper pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas and even bangers and mash  you will find an array of reasonably priced english pub food on the menu with entrees coming in at about 12 across the boardas ive said before i tend to go for the specials and that night it was moroccan stew  unfortunately i am sad to say it was disappointing  the dish was somewhere between a curry and a mexican chili and i was given a healthy serving for the 1299 pricepoint  but i couldnt help but become envious of those around me who had gravytopped pot pies crispy fish and chips beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas  i probably would not have been as putoff by the it if it was labelled on the menu as it was on my bill  just vegetable stew  it was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe and with a deliciouslooking curry dish on the main menu i expected more spice and life in my moroccan stew specialfor a visit to the duke i suggest going fullenglish  i saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item and how much more traditional can you get than that  also i have the famous deepfried pepperoni targeted  it has to be famous for a reasonat the end of it all the duke of kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd and provides a great atmosphere and service albeit a bit slow  but hey it was busy  my food may have only been soso but the brew was cold and my night was great
BLOMVxTereHbU8Y5kG1Cng 5 as soon as you step inside your first thought will likely be that there is no possible way this place was built to be an indian restaurant the entrance way is virtually nonexistent and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room at the back a long wooden barthe type youd feel comfortable seeing in a boston pizzaeclipses the view entirely the bar is far too big and completely takes away from the indian experience and the only dcor to be found is some dated indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees but trust me it doesnt matter in the slightest you likely wont even notice why because this place churns out some seriously outstanding indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring christie pits parksavoury and creamy butter chicken seasoned and spiced chicken masala bright and soft saffron rice all of the items youd expect to see on an indian menu are here ive been here a few times and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share especially if your experience with indian food is limited ordering a few samosas meat patties and cauliflower pakoras chickpea battered cauliflower and some peas pulao flavoured basmati rice a bowl of chicken masala chicken with yogourt and spices a bowl of fish curry masala spicedsalmon and a plate of naan bread tandoorifried bread for example allows you to try a lot of different things and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 peoplenow i dont want to just casually mention the naan bread like that id be doing it a profound injustice it is absolutely todiefor beyond good it is never made ahead of time its made right when you order it its soft cooked perfectly and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor ive stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else if youre there definitely order itpleasantly enough this place is never at a loss for staff any evening you decide to go youre sure to be taken care of one of the thingsand i cant believe im saying thisis that this place may actually be overstaffed ive gone there before and felt as if i may have been the servers only table despite being a packed house its a true joy to experiencei know i said that the ugly bar and awkward entranceway dont matter and they dont for me but if youre after more than just amazing indian food like say an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff then you may want to keep looking you wont find that here what you will find is skillfully cooked delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive friendly staff
vAq2xRLiQEwGdaoprAPvfg 3 bar salumi is the unassuming sister barcomerestaurant to the local kitchen in parkdale  it might be a little too unassuming for its own good as many people seemed to question its whereabouts when i mentioned its namebut maybe bar salumi doesnt like the spotlight  indeed its sign is almost an afterthought with the stores original signage for an antique shop dominating the storefrontmy friend and i had been meaning to go ever since she discovered they served burrata pizza  she really has a thing for that cheese and i cant say i blame her its delicious  we went awhile back excited at the prospect of this new twist on a margharita pie only to find out the chef was on vacation and they were only serving up the liquid portion of their menu  normally i wouldnt have a problem with this and in some cases i would actually prefer it but that night we were hungry and consequently deflated my friend entered the chefs eta in her phone and we vowed to returntwo weeks later the alarm sounded reminding us that the chef was back to work and also that she had golden potatoes ready to harvest in smurf village  we went the very next dayas it was on our previous visit bar salumi was quiet and dark illuminated by flickering chandeliers leftovers from the former antique shop maybe and tea light candles housed within mason jars  hanging legs of prosciutto fight for space with ceiling fans and a boars head watches diners from high above on the back wall  i know it might not sound like it what with the strong presence of dangling cured meat and taxidermy but it has a real romantic vibe happeningthere is no kitchen at bar salumi so our personable apronclad server was also our chef  the menu is a small one focused on pizza and apps so diners can watch as everything is prepared behind the bar it did get a bit hot what with the pizza oven operating from within the same room but think how cozy that would be on a winters nightthe menu is presented on the wall in cafeteria style or bowling alley fashion with those little plastic letters that slide in and out and i half expected to see nachos and cheese listed somewhere  more menus were brought to us on mini clipboards and because the food menu was unnecessary as we had fully rehearsed our order we paused awhile over the drink list  they offer a thoughtful selection of reds and whites as well as some interesting cocktails  we went with two glasses of malbec 12 each to go with our starter of olives  nodini with ricotta salata 4  so far so good except that i couldnt help but think the nodini crackers werent the most functional choice for the cheesemore like basketball hoops for the olivesour pizza 14 although not woodfired did come served on a crosssection of a tree trunk  with the creamy white burrata blending with the red of the san marzano tomatoes punctuated by basil it was like an homage to the italian flag  i wish i could say that the burrata we were so looking forward to made it the penultimate margharita experience but it was like any other made with bufala  the two are from the same family after all so im not sure what we were thinking  cheese does things to people  that being said however we werent disappointed as the sauce was tangy the crust was crispy and it was big enough for both of us to eat and still take home leftoversi wouldnt rank the pizza with the likes of pie giants terroni or libretto but bar salumi is rife with ambience where the aforementioned arent  the promise of buratta may have lured me in the first time but its the character that will bring me back
3kYgvvUUMP6nR49sTWrmCw 1 hey meatball hey mediocre walking into hey meatball instantly feels like you are walking into your old high school cafeteria a few two and four person tables are set up and theres one long 16 person table down the middle all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners i wasnt entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction we inquired with the cashierorder takerowner to find out i know he was the owner because he told usfor a restaurant that serves all meatballs all the time we were surprised to find that there were only three entre selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from of the four side dishes two had already been crossed out for the day leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup i decided to order the vegetarian eggplant meatballs with polenta and parmesan and my dining partner ordered the porky  meatballs a combination of pork and ground beef with tomato sauce on spaghetti immediately i was told that they were out of polenta and was asked what would i like it on unsure of my options even after asking i replied with spaghetti as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that i was sure that they had in stockwe each ordered a homemade cream soda we were given a number and we took a seat our number was called out about 10 minutes later and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size my eggplant meatballs were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the childrens menu if there was one that isthe food was good but not great the eggplant meatballs had a nice consistency and were spicy and full of flavor the tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty however i thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more the porky meatballs were excellent the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dishthe saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site they were a throwback to the jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid but without too much fizz unfortunately when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience you know that there is something missinghey meatball is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100mile radius of toronto all great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept but here it just didnt seem to create anything memorable there was no music playing while we were in and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made hey meatball mostly a letdown
We853schI2SMtGPJHYHYtA 3 3030 has youngprofessional written all over it craft beers slightly pretentious menu and crowd its junction location sigh i remember the days when they avoided this area and although i spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood i only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago thats mostly because its a difficult place to notice with an unassuming simple 3030 stenciled on the front door and not much else to identify it3030 is huge inside seriously huge especially for a place in the junction stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars it seems more like youre in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant and thats with good intention 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a foodvenue and in my opinion not the other way around although thats what they go for in the off hoursone things for sure they put a lot of thought into their draft selection the back bar has taps full of localish craft brews including wellington beaus and even some other more difficult ones to find like the junction craft brewings ipa which was fantastic a sawdust city stout and a broadhead white clearly they take their beer selection very seriously the unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on you get the distinct that they dont want you hanging out theremuch like youd expect from a place aimed at youngpros in the junction sigh the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out with shelves full of board games and walls lined with oldschool pinball machines and plenty of interesting art with the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening it gives the perfect backdrop to a night outbut with just a little 5 dollar snack menu card on each table you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve there was only 4 of them at the time but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right i asked if the items changed daily hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them but nope these items had been here for a while she said while its cool to try items out to see what works i hope that eventually theyll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu or at least one that changes seasonallybecause none of their mains sounded appealing to us we instead opted for the items on the snack menu the butter chicken wings while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours youd expect arrived lukewarm the potato wedges on the other hand were indescribably and inedibly  hot which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways overall we just didnt find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at allif youre in the neighbourhood 3030 may be worth checking out but id say solely for their draft selection and although the fact that there isnt much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out id wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek in my opinion it just isnt worth going out of your way forwith a gabbys now opened next door i remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil corporate chain but really its of little consequence its obvious right away that theyll both be attracting very different types of people
-4BMAgivIQ7hj3ca_Wnapw 3 i know st lawrence market is full of great food but i never wouldve thought that tucked way in the back of the building id find something quite like busters sea covekeep in mind though this takeout shop isnt rodneys or oyster boy and im definitely not trying to convince you that it is in fact busters sea cove isnt even in the same boat at busters you wont find soft lighting romantic ambience or tableside service but what youre pretty much guaranteed to find is some killer seafood served up really really quicklyfreshmade fish and chips are the staple in this place but theyve got so much more than that their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fishtopped salads and their fishtype sandwiches something that they happen to do really really well are outstanding im not talking about your standard old friedfishonabun here busters rivals the best seafood takeout places with crab cake paninis and seared tuna melts sandwichesbut dont overlook the fish and chips either this little takeout stand easily delivers one of the best plates of the stuff in the city theyve got a few varieties of fish to choose from and each of them is served up expertly battered and crispy each plate of fish and chips also comes with inhouse made fries and a killer slawbusters also has a few other options you wouldnt expect from a takeout stand grilled swordfish seafood bisque rainbow trout even octopus to name a few it aint fine dining by any means but they truly do push the limits of what takeout is both in quality and selectionchances are though once you get your food youll be spending most of your time searching for a place to eat it busters only has 4 tables or so scattered around in front of the counter but if those are fulland they probably will beyoure on your own theres an exit close by to the markets back patio and parking lot where most of busters customers end up but trust me if its a nice day out thatll fill up pretty quick too and youll be left looking for a place to eat your bythengettingcold foodtruth be told though even if youre standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways it wont matter all that much you might not even notice whether its a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips the food at busters is just that dam good

-WfxuhNncKIljj7ZssL2lw 3 for the past year or so ive been meaning to go to mitzis cafe for brunch  weekends however draw a big crowd and my ninetofive job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd  fortunately having resigned from my job to be a writer see unemployed i am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say a tuesdaywhich is exactly what i did this weeki love mitzis location  tucked away on a quiet corner of sorauren surrounded by century homes purple and yellow painted mitzis is a bit outofplace but thats the appeal  i have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores and thats what mitzis reminds me of  inside looked exactly how i both expected and hoped for arborite tables with mismatched chairs a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time and walls adorned with local art  i really really wanted to like this placeand like it i did however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience  lets start with mine shall we  mitzis has a small but thoughtful menu and i had previously perused it online so i knew exactly what i wanted  craving sweet over savoury i ordered the french toast as planned 1095  made with challah bread it is then topped with a peach  ginger compote covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup the last step done by yours truly  it was fantastic  the bread was thick and fluffy and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it  it had all the makings of a dessertin a breakfast  it should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream but i decided it was too much of an indulgence says the person who used so much syrup as to make her french toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessonssitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup but not completely out of its reach were the home fries which offset the sweetness of the french toast nicely  made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly  my only complaint is that there werent more of them but its probably for the best in the long run  if the toast itself was the star of the show then the home fries were the understudyas i had already had my morning coffee i chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orangebananamango juice  it was just thick enough to know it was the real thing and at 3 i think it was good valuethe glowing endorsement ends with my friends order  she was so looking forward to her poached eggs also 1095  served on portuguese cornbread topped with wilted spinach  and slathered in roasted red pepper  asiago sauce it looked delicious when set down in front of her but as she cut into the egg with her fork the yolk failed to flow  her poached eggs werent poached at all they were hardboiled  cue the violins tasty yes but it wasnt what she wanted and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping dutythis would have been a 4 star review had i made it a solo trip but alas the poached eggs or lack thereof knocked it down a peg  mitzis is still worth a visit though for the french toast and i hear the oatmeal buttermilk pancakes are pretty killer too but if its poached eggs you crave be specificif only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being
NksQNx6WYTR2x2vfo2BYTw 3 relatively new to the king west theatre district and across the street from the bell lightbox is paese  new to the neighbourhood but not new to the restaurant scene paese has been operating out of their bathurst street location since 1989  serving up italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere paese might give longtime district resident kit kat some competitionwith a monochromatic colour scheme butcher block tables and exposed brick paese is very welcoming even for someone who happened to be dining alone see yours trulymy server brought the customary bread to the tablebut this was no ordinary bread and oil the bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour  it came with an olive rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty  i tried to stop after one slice but failed miserably  i managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but id be lying if i said i wasnt staring at it longingly throughout dinnernext came my beet caprese salad 13  grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds  the combination of flavours and textures worked well together and it was just a very fresh salad overall if seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring  it was filling enough to be my main course but i wasnt done yetas full of bread and beets as i was i couldnt wait for my cavatelli 13  hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasnt as filling  the sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers and thats a compliment as although she wasnt italian she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the yearsi had initially sent away the wine menu although im not sure why exactly  maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and i had another review to dobut those are hardly excuses not to partake  its part of the job after all  either way one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table  smart manpaese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass  now im no expert on wine but i do drink a lot of the stuff so i know what i like and i like amarone  i was given a sample of a 2004 fumanelli amarone before committing to a full glass after which i gave the go ahead for my server to fill er up  rich and fullbodied it was a great complement to my meal but as far as im concerned it would be a great complement to anythingcheese pasta breakfastbecause of its location i probably wont make a repeat visit but i dont think paese is having a hard time attracting other customers  i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show
U893kSY5zzJEnSiwHarvZg 3 the bar with no name recently opened up in the place where the everempty zbar used to be and the signs of them still working out the kinks of being a newly opened place are still there it was fairly obvious that the space was still in the process of being turned into something else and there was still a lot of remenants of zbar to be found ive been to zbar once and i couldnt really tell the difference between the two except for the kickass inviting new bar with no name sign out frontsimply put no names staff are amazing thoughtful and exactly how food biz staff shoudl be they were really concerned with making sure we had a good time and because of them our experience was good even though the place was busy they still made time to chat with us and didnt make us feel rushedno names food menu was the standard bar fare burgers wings and fried foods were front and center but despite the plainness of the menu the food was hot fresh and served the way it should bethe music in this place however really needs some improvements we probably would have stayed for another drink if it wasnt for commercials blasted over the radio being the only form of entertainment i asked if they could put some sattelite radio on and i was told not to worry because a dj was going to be playing soon i left at 1030 and i never saw or heard a dj just leons loblaws and car commercials at full volumeit does seem as though they rushed to open and they probably could have used another week or two to get things together but once they get it all worked out this place stands a great chance at becoming the perfect neighbourhood hangoutwe plan to review again in two months
oZ5iRUkGiJ_r27Z9pJKR-w 3 there is a new kid in town and his name is pachuco  named after the look and style of mexican youth back in the 1930s to 1950s that dressed in zoot suits pachuco opened its doors on friday january 13th perhaps a sign of bad luck but that shouldnt hinder their successpachuco is a small read reservations and cozy space with exposed brick walls wroughtiron dcor and and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign even though pachuco shares a kitchen with older brother and danforth favourite  embrujo flamenco they definitely serve up their own distinctive flavourtheir menu is well thought out and varied with an excellent selection of meat fish and vegetarian dishes their appetizer menu alone is worth the trip with a confident boasting of guacamole flavours including goat cheese blue cheese smoked trout and walnut and a guacamole sampler patter that allows you to try three of their creations there is seemingly no end to the interesting flavour combinations we decided to stick to our guns however and go with the traditional guacamole which was a stellar choice lots of lime onion and creamy avocado but with no flavour left too overpowering their homemade tortilla chips have to be mentioned as well crisp and tasty i am hoping they will one day provide these in a togo bag for purchase before you leave we also ordered the chile poblana swathed in an excellent and perfectly spicy tomato sauce with queso fresco and refried beans all baked perfectly the portion size on both entrees was more than enough for two people and it could easily serve as a great entrefor our meals both 15 we went with the taquitos de machaca coffee and ancho braised beef brisket with guacamole and honey chipotle salsa and the prehispanic delicacy of taquitos de huitlacoche corn truffle onions jalapeo peppers cazuela beans served with requesnavocado salsa where to start lets save the most interesting for last the braised beef was well cooked and well spiced the chipotle salsa was a great added touch and one order of beans and rice between the two of us was more than enough to share in fact we both left incredibly full their freshthissecond corn tortillas are amazing sweet soft and still warm from the press prepared just the way you would expect to find them in a traditional mexican eatery the huitlacoche however was an adventure in and of itself for those who dont know myself included huitlacoche is a fungus which grows naturally on corn in damp environments the fungus is harvested and has been consumed as a delicacy for centuries in central and south america cuisine when it arrived it tasted smokey and earthy it looked like a dark mash of black corn onion and was that a jalapeo in there hard to tell the dish was good but i cant say i would strongly recommend it overall i found the food at pachucos to be mostly oversalted and the huitlacoche had to be the worst offender this is the main reason why i would not order it again although the flavour was very different from any other mexican dishes i have tried and i actually did enjoy it i just could not get over the intensity of the salt the drinks and food at pachucos ranged from good to very good and if they could tone down the salt margaritas included i would probably rate most of it as excellent however i cannot say our overall experience was excellent but i would not fault them for it in my overall rating being that it was their opening weekend one expects a few hiccups and i am sure they will be cleared up by the time you visit i was served the wrong meal at first and we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the huitlacoche to be prepared instead of the fish tacos though delightful looking i was initially served by the time my dish came around the other half of our meal was cold our side plates and used cutlery were never removed from our table after we finished with our appetizers and the tables are so small and cramped as it is there was no room for our mains instead of removing our side plates there was a vain attempt to stuff everything on the table i eventually had to ask for fresh cutlery and removal of the used dishes from our table not once but twice we almost had our notquitefinished drinks taken from us and we had to ask a few times for extra tortillas it seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time and as great as they were they are very very small so i imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own overall i think these are minor complaints especially since it was pachucos opening preview i found that the service was friendly and genuine the restaurant was quaint and ambient with latin music candles and a few kitschy dcor details which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to its selfproclaimed modern mexican dining experience

XuVRnFe_37dnavJBdUQ0tw 1 boyohboy do i ever feel let down i actually went out of my way to go to this place one day when i was craving some goodolefashionedbbq claiming to be serving it up in true southernstyle i thought that theres no way this could go wrong ive actually been to texas and all throughout the southern states on a fairly serious eating vacation and lemme tell you something the drake and their lil bbq place owe the great state of texas and its surrounding neighbours a serious apologydrake bbq has a slew of great reviews all over the internet everyone on yelp twitter and a bunch of to food mags have been raving about the authentic badass texas and carolina style bbq theyve had in this place ive read so many good comments that i figured i must have gone to the wrong place maybe i thought there was some other place that just happens to look exactly the same on the exact same street with the exact same type of foodnope i was in the right place it just sucked is allbecause they have such a loyal following im sure quite a few people are going to dislike what im saying here but in all honesty if you got served what i did youd be disappointed too my carolina pulledpork sandwich was small dry and amazingly enough was completey void of bbq sauce which is a fairly important staple in a pulledpork sandwich they must have had some bbq sauce somewhere in there but if they did they didnt offer it to me and it certainly wasnt on my sandwich my coleslaw was even worse it was incredibly bland and wasnt much more than shredded cabbage with a slight trace of what i assume was salad dressing not to mention that this stuff was expensive two of those sandwiches and an ittybitty coleslawplus tip of coursecost over 20 buckswelcome to the drake bbq its bbq with a side of pretentiousness you dont like it trust me if its the same guy working behind the counter when i was there then he wont care at all i asked if we could get some fries with our sandwiches he just looked at me shocked and said i dont want a deepfryer in this place hey im fine with the guy being pretentious and true to the stuff hes making and how hes making it especially if its honesttogoodness southernstyle bbq if he truly was an artisan of the bbq and the smoker he can rightfully be as pretentious as he wants as far as im concerned i probably would have answered back with an agreeing yes sir but the true kickintheass was that the stuff that i ended up taking home in a sad little brown bag was basically less than edible in fact i only took a few bites and ended up throwing it out which is something i never ever do someone went and filled thsi guys head with the thought that this is actually what good bbq is all about someone lied to himbesides being about honest and delicious bbq the southern states are all about hospitality and genuine people people that would never be rude or unwelcoming theyre more likely to invite you in for dinner than they are to turn you away drake bbq was none of those things the service was rude inhospitable and unwelcoming from the moment i walked in i felt as though they wanted me the hell outta there that is except for the older guy that handed me the bag he sent me off with a sincere sounding thanks for your business which is something i think businesses dont say enough these dayslike i said this was painful for me i felt ripped off i felt sad i felt let down it was a just a plain bad experience that was nothing close to true southern bbq or southern hospitality in fact i dont think i would even give it another go and whether youve been exposed to true southern bbq or not id suggest you dont either because youll feel let down either way too
RO5eUIT1C1MLsCY9cJCM5g 3 tapas seem to be all the hype recently and its easy to see why not only does it allow you to try more things on the menu but its also perfect for when youre  with a larger group and that is just the reason why a couple of my friends and i headed to the ossington area to try out foxley an asianvietnamese inspired tapas housethe restaurant ambiance doesnt mimic anything i typically associate with a traditional vietnamese restaurant it has a classier fine dining style of dcor with ginger brick walls and soft lighting its a  perfect romantic date spot in fact we saw lots of couples there that night all dining on a few plates and enjoying winemy friends and i decided to follow suit so we split a bottle of red and ordered the most interesting dishes that caught our eyes on the menu this however was a task easier said than done the menu comes on a singlesided laminated sheet with no pictures it was hard to distinguish where the descriptions of one dish started and the next one ended it felt a little like reading an essay but once you get over the poor formatting youll be amazed by the variety of dishes that they offer there is no shortage of exotic meats and dishes like frog legs and beef hearts but if youre not feeling that adventurous rest assured they also do have many good old reliable classics like deep fried shrimps steamed mussels and spring rollsthe first dish that came was the lamb and duck prosciutto dumplings 7 these were served hotcrunchy and  with jam packed with minced lamb stuffing theyre tasty but nothing too specialnext came a sea bream creviche with yuzu and shiso 15 theyre bite sizes pieces of thinly sliced sea bream sashimi covered with coriander and some lime puree i actually found them to be a little too citrusy for my liking but it is undeniably fresh it was paired well with the crunchy fried onions generously sprinkled on topafter that a whole slew of dishes came at the same time and it was difficult to figure out which one to dig into first they all looked and smelled so appetizing the grilled marinated beef short ribs 14 came on a small plate with about 34 pieces a little too chewy for my liking but it was at least well marinated and flavourful in comparison the grilled side ribs with caramelized shallot glaze 900 were delicious they were made up of two long pork ribs covered in a savory sweet glaze with meat that fell right off the bone we literally demolished that dish in a couple of secondsif youre a big fan of pork belly as i am then youll be in for a real treat at foxley they serve a slowbraised pork belly in muscatel reduction 15 with nicely marbled fat and cooked in a delicious smokey barbeque sauce it just melts in your mouthand while all those dishes were great my favourite of the night was the grilled beef heart with chili lime salsa 8 we ordered it just to try something new and it was the best decision of the night it came nicely grilled on two skewers so that the hearts are slightly charred on the outside for flavour and still tender on the inside dont be afraid to try this one it actually doesnt taste as farfetched as it soundsto balance out all the meat we ordered the chef recommended the kale salad with pecorino toscano and lemon dressing 8 i love kale so in my books this salad was definitely a good order my only complaint was that the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too sourupon finishing up the meal the first thought i had was that foxley is not as asian fusion as i had anticipated there are some influences but not nearly enough for me to notice the asian aspect of the menu that does not go to say that i didnt enjoy my meal though while i found it was a little on the pricier side i did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere keep foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends
j1eUfIWCc-IlZNmRlROqtQ 1 disgraceland isnt bad but its definitely a bit overrated thier biggest fault is that its completly hitormiss somedays everything comes together other times their menu takes an exceptionally creative look at stuff youd expect to find in the southern states with heavy concern for those that prefer meatless everything from southernfried chicken and tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches they also have a fairly original selection of sauces to dip your fries in thats worth mentioning the staff are cool layedback and they actually seem to care that youre therebut like i said all of that can change the next time you go in food could come out luke warm and greasy staff could be stuckup and simply not care disappointingly enough the one thing that you can count on that disgraceland has that is consistently great is one hellofa cool name
gaA9Z9LCdju57P3-6PHEQg 5 i came across the burgers priest purely by accident one day when i was biking in the beaches neighbourhood its an easy little place to overlook its just a small shop with little advertising way out on queen east but boy am i ever glad i stumbled onto this place hands down this was one of the best burgers ive had in toronto first off it was actually cooked a little over medium without me asking truly a rarity nowadays the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature beautiful besides being cooked perfectly the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury pattythe fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy inhouse while that makes them perfect for eating right away i do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them but for me it was pure fry blissthe space is modern clean and stainlesssteel heavy but because of its size it only has seating for about 4 people once the place gets a lineup which at peak times is completely inevitable the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat innext time you happen out to the beaches definitely check this place out or even if youre not in the neighbourhood this place is totally worth the drivecheck out our blog at wwwtofoodreviewscom
r13Q1UVbPED1I-RRsbJDgw 1 the kensington cornerstone offers a gluten free menu  it has gluten free beer  it has a cute patio and its painted to look like a circus tent  i chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons  it checked a lot of boxes on my list  i wont be going backthis past weekend found me turning another year older and because ive been experimenting with a glutenreduced diet as of late i decided my birthday dinner should be had at the kensington cornerstone  i looked at pictures  i perused the menu  i read reviews  it all seemed positiveit was a beautiful evening so i was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio  we had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings people watching kensington offers some of the best and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street just when i was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables pitcher of beer our waitress appeared  the up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time  while we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria andor mojitos andor margaritas we all ended up opting for beer  my girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of upper canada lager while i decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections  i figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop so i stuck to my guns  ive had what nicklebrook has to offer in the line of gf beer so i was looking forward to trying a new one  i asked our server what the most popular one was and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by la messagre that operates out of montrealwhen our drinks arrived i took that first sip so full of hope and for a split second i thought i was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend i know im nice arent i that my beer didnt taste horrible  i didnt have that chance  did i just drink beer  or did i just suck on a penny  even i was a bit confused at that point  it started off so well but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat  bitterjust like i was at that pointso by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered  our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish  thank goodness our server was coming our way  but instead of food she came bearing bad news  my girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out and for some reason they just thought to tell her now  not only would we have to wait even longer for our food but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us sound of clock tickinganother half hour passed and our meals finally arrived  as hungry as i was i couldnt make it through my sandwich 13  it looked appetizing enough but the pork wasnt nearly as tender as it should have been ive been spoiled by the likes of fidel gastro lately and the sauce was a bit of a turnoff being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro  the gluten free bread was quite good and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice so it was now more of a sponge  yes a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy but you should still be able to pick it up my mom was impressed with her salmon 18 but she wouldnt complain if there was a gun to her head  it did look good though and the portion was generous so not all was lostlooking back on it now i wish i had just scrapped the gf diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant  what was i thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner  why did i go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something i love on my special day  who does that  so while im not taking the blame away from the restaurant i will share some of it with thembut only some as the service was really what ruined our experience  maybe the food wasnt amazing but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult  the servers themselves were lovely girls but somewhere back in the kitchen the ball was dropped after we begrudgingly paid our bill i decided to throw the whole gf thing out the window and head to ronnies for a bottle of gluten rich 50 to end the night on a positive note as we sat there on the patio i couldnt help but stare across the road at the grilled cheese  oh what could have been

GuD3Og1PmJCqXAiWQe1xew 3 i have been here 3 12 years   the staff is always smiling and helpful   yes it takes maintenance a little longer then they should but it seems like a large place for only 2 guys to handel   the fitness center needs a little upgrade but i have lived at other places and this is a great place  i see a few people complaining and name calling which i find childish  if they hate it so much why dont they move

5QY5zA25mkmfA9dTRA6KbQ 5 i cant say enough about what brenda has done for us my husband and i rescued pepper and knew he was the dog for us despite the expected behavior problems coming from a rescued pup she helped me identify the core of our issues with pepper and we faced them headon i had a perfectly behaved dog inside my apartment sit stay free park it code for go lay down no problem our struggle was on walks and going anywhere pepper is an incredibly protective pup and any dog or cat we saw from any distance would evoke jumping and barking which was incredibly impactful on our lifestyle i had zero control over him outside of the apartment brenda taught me how to gain control outside of my home and brought a variety of different dogs to increase peppers tolerance to dogs and to practice my new favorite term leave it long story short we are still working everyday to improve peppers socialization but we recently had a doggy play date and he did amazing i can go on walks without an overwhelming feeling of panic walk by cats without worry and can even take the occasional hike when we know we only have to practice leave it a few times  i am no longer afraid to take our dog for a long walk or to bring him to new places
3mOl94tk3YnpYAzsSKzziA 1 i do not recommend this store they were so bad it actually made me set up a yelp account so that i could review them a friend sent flowers for my birthday which they tried to deliver late in the afternoon when i was not at home  when the girl called she said that they would redeliver the flowers the next morning i told her to bring them to my neighbor as that i would not be at home my neighbor waited at home till 12 noon and no flowers arrived  i  got home at 12 and called them and said where are my flowers  the woman apologized and said that her supervisor would give me a call of course no call so i called them yet again they said they were on the truck and would be here by the end of the day  once again no flowers so i called again and said hey its almost closing time for you where are my flowers the answer was dont worry theyll be there  they werent  next morning my father waited at my house for the delivery of the missing flowers of course again no flowers  so i called them at 12 noon again and said if i do not have them by the end of the day i would be coming into the store personally and picking up my flowers or canceling the order for my friend shockingly the flowers showed up a half hour later of course they were no longer in the best condition they werent horrible but they werent the freshest either of course they were now almost 3 days late i would not recommend this store they didnt even seem to care that was the worst part

sjvlLg6iKlsw4pje1-FElg 3 i have passed this spot hundreds of times but being a creature of habit i have never stopped to try opting instead for fenwicks oh fenwicks must write a reviewwhich is almost next door  when i found a coupon in our citipass book for a free sushi roll i decided to give it a tryunassuming atmosphere which i appreciate  generally when i dine i am looking for a food experience espeically in this pricepoint  they have a very limited wine list and a very limited beer selection no cocktails  which again is all fine who cant enjoy a tsing taowe ordered a spicy tuna roll a summer roll special roll of the evening and a crunchy roll  my husband enjoyed all of them  i on the other hand dont love spicy mayo on all of my rolls so i enjoyed but did not love  but for the price it is definitely worth a try  i fear i have turned into a sushi snob our service was finetip wear a sweater  it was freezing in there
s3a5WnVtA5tknXqKcKvC4w 3 this is a fine place to dine but nothing special  i do appreciate that they have vegetarian chili which is the perfect topping for their taco salad  the taco salad is good as are the huge baked potatoes  kids dine free at mcalisters on various evenings but the kids menu is not great and the portions are for toddlers this is a quick in and out and in the winter a good place to grab a cup of soup as the offerings change daily  the sweet tea gets 4 stars
l_xCcePP38yNSPrlziIQSA 3 jalapeno pale ale  yes please  mexicali stout  yep  the onsite brewed beer here is awesome  creative delicious and local  a perfect hat trick of beersthey had a great accoustic singer who started in the afternoon but got talked into playing into the evening he was fantasticthe atmosphere is pretty barebones which is nice  a long picnic table some bar tables and some covered outdoor seating that i cannot wait to try  it was cold in there my husband wore his coat and i used mine as a blanket the service is friendly  the crowd as usual for noda is ecclectic and fun friendly and nonpretentious  they also offer a 12 gallon fillup to go or to enjoy onsite which was a great price at 14bonus they serve peanuts
W_sbnKfvzxlgNNqqg93Orw 3 seriously this restaurant has 4 crepe options on the menu for dinner  totally disappointed the spinach and mushroom crepe was delicious but it was the only vegetarian option  call me crazy but with a name like crepe cellar i imagined several optionsthe tap beers are a sampling of the uk which is great but the best local brews are a block awaythe atmosphere is nice  we sat at the bar  my hubs had the fish and chips which he enjoyed  we skipped dessert  might be a better option for brunch
UEoac96rKNfVM0_UKUQGqg 3 my 5 year old attended art camp here with a friend  it was a 3 hour camp and when i realized it was only 4 days instead of 5 the value of this camp sharply decreased oh  but wait a minute they released a coupon for pay for one child and the second goes free  score  this only worked for me because i had not paid for our session yet  had i already paid this deal would not have applied  imagine how disappointed my responsible earlypaying friend was when she realized the offer was not available to herthe camp itself was well run and organized  the art work was adorable  my daughter had a great time and did not get too messy  they also gave them fun snacksthe camp is advertised for up to age 10 but my free 10 year old only went twice as it is really geared toward the younger children
SlHJXZTUERz2vFh543KicA 3 i love a lot of things and live music is at the top of my list  this venue has a great old school place feel and is a fun place to take in a show  it appeared to be cement from floors to ceiling with two different stages one for a bigger show and one for a smaller crowd it is definitely not the belk theatre but i cut my teeth at the milestone so a grungyish venue is fun for me there were pool tables a few booths and bar tables near the bar and a great outdoor area with seating and fun colorful lights  the bartenders were friendly and they have a great selection of beer on tap and the beer is reasonably priced  they also have a full bar but with some good local beers on tap why not support our budding qc brewery marketthe accousitcs were fine  but i enjoyed the prince concert at twc which received awful reviews for accoustics i am jazzed about another great venue from which i can get my music fix  psychedelic furs anyone
FadohB_xUDDuhNRHPiSWYQ 3 target at midtown is a fantastic shopping experience especially if you happen to have val as your cashier  she is a smacktalking hootseriously with parking that protects you from rain and all aisles usually open how can you not love this target  dont get me wrong i am all about shopping local but with 3 children that need a dump truck load of backtoschool supplies target is my choice  and seriously where else can you pick up a cute top scarf and set of sheets while simultaneously loading up a cart with colored pencils paper and notebooks  and their junior dept clothes while tricky to find smaller sizes are hard to distinguish from pricier brands a huge bonus to this mother of a middle schooler
_1VmRHWm9gs0-N6TLlDPBA 5 i am not a 5star person  i think everyoneeverything has room for improvement  but fenwicks  they are spoton delicious every time  this is owned and operated by catherine of catherines on providence for any oldtime charlottean  she is a superb chef  her culinary and wine skills are some of the best in charlottethis is not fine dining  it is not fancy  in fact it is quirky and small and you often feel a little close to your dining neighbor  must try  tomato bisque soup it comes as a side option with their meals  my hubbie says these are the best burgers in charlotte i am a veggie and i beleive their grilled veggie burger is the best in town  their fries are great  sweet potato fries  delicious  tuna salad with  meltinyourmouth croutons and an array of homemade dressings to choose from  pure yumminess  my husband also adores the club sandwich  oh and the muffins  delectableas creatures of habit my order is always the same veggie burger with cheese side of soup and fruit  and this is a 5star meal delivered with 5star service  sit at the bar and get to know your neighborspretty tight for families with children i dont bring my younger ones in here
8MQ4k_NResZ6H4c8ZS8y_Q 5 me lovesthe stir fried wide noodles are perfection  the make your own spring rolls are my favorite a big plate overflowing with fresh mint basil cilantro noodles bean sprouts cucumber and tofu  soak your rice wrap in the hot water fill with goodness squirt with siriachi and dip in sauce  delight taste buds  repeat again and againthe atmosphere is nothing to write home about but with authentic food like this who caresrestroom is yucky bring sanitizermy kids love this dining experience
2nI2kKeoXlBAdPk6MoBTsA 5 this has been a favorite for 13 years or more  i have tried a lot of the menu items and have never been disappointed but my favorite remains the makeyourown spring rolls  a close second is the vegetable hotpot and my children love like squealoutloud love the fried pineapple rice it arrives in a pineapple boat and it is deliciousfirst off you do not come here for atmosphere  they have gussied the place up a bit with some fake bamboo and updated posters on the walls  the fact that you can see a run down laundromat and a car inspeciton station that may or may not be boarded up should not deter you from this spot  do come for the hot tea the service and the food  it is outstanding  although the rumor is the original lang van owners are now the owners of ben thanh which might explain my love affair with that restaurant  the staff is so helpful and knowledgable in assisting with food selections  we have taken several people here for their first visit and our waitperson has always helped make selections that were enjoyed by our gueststhe food is plentiful  you will not leave here hungry  flat noodles hot pots and spring rolls are our favorites and the aforementioned fried pineapple  we also love the little cookies that come with the check perfectly sweet but do have peanutsthis is a fun place to bring a small group of people 6ish to sit around a round table and share foodthis is a great restaurant for children to experience delicious and healthy food  the servers dote on wellbehaved children here
zDSlyv7-JnnI5epuDRhxPg 5 i cannot say enough about this church and i dont know where to startaside from the obvious the church is utterly gorgeous the people are what make this place truly spectacular  there is a widely diverse population at this church which can be surprising to new visitors  there is a buddhist group that meets here a sunday school class for lgbt and friends and people of all colors  the minister here is stephen shoemaker and he is incredibly educated intellectual and compassionate  he is a pillar in the faith community in charlotte  the outreach of this church is also impressive  service projects and taking care of thy neighbor abounds herethere are great sunday school classes for adults and children alike  the little ones often are found riding tricycles in the gym after ss and during the church service  there are sports teams a gym art classes computer classes etc offered here  we have participated in many and loved them allthey also have really great small group offerings interested in art  drinking beer at pubs  going to movies  and somehow tying this back into christianity  or maybe you want to be an earth keeper a hiker or a yogi  they have it allmy favorite thing about this church  no need to check your intellect at the door
Rs6tbf7w-SASMxYJJBaXCA 5 dr eap is a healer in the truest sense of the word  she not only has her naturopathic degree from one of the most esteemed programs in the country she also lived and studied with ancient healers and monks in asia  she is a true holistic practitioner mind body spirit  this is an experience unlike any othershe uses kinesiology to test the body for weaknesses  she then prescribes any array of herbal supplements and other unconventional treatments  sometimes it feels a little voodooish but conventional doctors are just practicing medicine and dispensing potent drugs with known side effects both seem scary to me but the natural approach seems less so  and honestly i showed up barely able to function from tiredness and fatigue beaten up from medical procedures and under the care of an oncologist for a noncancerous condition  she really restored my energyi credit dr eap for restoring my health back to a place of wellness  it is expensive and not covered by insurancei eventually had to stop going the supplements were getting to be too many for me to keep up withi will definitely go again when my pocketbook and time can manage it
NZ2zjo_GihoCd4AU9kqqcQ 5 great knowledgeable and friendly service first the nice manboy not sure how old he is looked like a baby acted like a polite adult was awesome in making sure i was buying the best helmets for my kids  he went in and out of their stock room several times to get it all correct  secondly he asked if i needed boxes i didnt have to arm wrestle him for them and he was genuinely excited when he found out i was santathey loaded all my christmas loot into my sleigh that looks like a suburban   they also have the cutest chocolate lab that is in here on occasion  seriously who does not love the beautiful face and aggressive wagging of the tail of a lab    this place has all the snow and skateboard gear one might need  great priced helmets for skating and skiing great penny board selection  the toms ugg sanuk and rainbow shoe selection is insane  seriously blows nordstrom out of the water kids and adult sizes  and sanuks are hard to find my husband loves them and so does my brother in law who is a surgeon and on his feet all day  they are also hip without being hipster   but with skinny jeans could def fall into the hipster category
tAvLRntFoaPFgho-9vNmKg 3 i love dr sowell and all of his office staff  i could not find it in me to give a dentist 5stars  i dread and i do mean dread going to the dentist his hygenists are awesome  melissa is my favorite  his front desk staff is wonderful  for those suffering from severe dental anxiety he will give a magic pill 30 minutes prior to any work to be done  i have not done this yethe also sees wellbehaved children that said he sees 2 of 3 of mine  and is great with themtheir reschedule policy is difficult dont cancel appointments
ct6uRcO49L4LeVveF1YSMQ 3 with 100 icees cherry coke or mixed and 50 cent vanilla ice cream cones this is a great place to treat children to something special  the indoor play area is clean and never crowded  bk also offers veggie burgers but make sure to ask them to hold the mayo if you do not want your sandwich swimming in it
OTOb2TcTAURs_9mqhqV2Ew 3 i do love this park really i do but i do not feel safe here by myself or alone with my children hence the 3 stars in fact i was stopped by a police officer who told me as much  so with 3 children in tow we loaded up and went to another park  i was thankful he told me this as i was feeling like that but felt i was being paranoid  without that significant detail this would be a 4 star park  i think the little splash park is big fun for younger children although it can get quite crowded and there are as always those parents who do not monitor their childrens behaviorthe playground is super fun  big fast slide and great swings  great recycled plastic chips in lieu of mulchawesome picnic shelter and wonderful open field for kick ball or soccernice winding paths that feel like you are really in the woods instead of steps from one of charlottes cutest neighborhoodsi did find several used condoms on the playground and on the lovely walking paths  this is not a goto park for me charlotte has too many wonderful options
5AaqmPwBBcxE_vB6k8fFyQ 5 i love this park  i love the tennis courts  i love the lake or pond  i love the aggressive geese that steal picnic dinners out of unsuspecting childrens hands  i love the interesting people that study read and play frisbee on hippie hill  i love the bridge to the band shell  i love the yoga that is offered here on occasion  i love the caddywampus dogs that people are walking here  i love the random fishermen  i love catching a little bit of a baseball game here  i love the train  i love the second playground with its big sandbox and swings  i love the nature trails  but the thing i love the most is having a picnic in this park on a lovely day loading my car with scooters and bicycles and balls and dolls and watching my children behave wildly  i also love the lacrosse for girls offered by cyla at this park  festival in the park is a fun but crowded event held here annuallylots of charity walks and runs herebathrooms are at your own risk  yucky
_E5scWVmbBTI0Np935N9lw 3 the leo has to be one of the best salads in charlotte with its chopped lettuce and mint and parsley cucumber and tomatoes it cannot get into my mouth fast enough  the pita that comes with it is perfect for sponging up the remaining lemon vinegarette that is too tasty to wastei like the falafel here too  crispy on the outside and not mealy on the inside  my hubs likes the meat specials and gyroand the baklava  like taking a bite out of an angel
UoF-5dCaRGZwq9bDId_HOw 3 i love this teeter not as overwhelming as the taj mteeter  i generally find a good parking place and they generally have all otheir lanes open with a bagger in each lane  i appreciate all of those things  if you shop vic specials the teeter is a good value  you will shoot your wad if you run in here unprepared without a list in handthe management at this store is incredibly gracious  i brought home some ht organic milk that was spoiled  i returned it and they refunded my money and gave me the name brand equivalent  my kids love all the samples they have out in the store  bonus
O99GTqVDcUvGxNCiArSkiA 3 one of lifes most frustrating experiences is shopping for  and with  a middle school daughter  she chose this as our destination  really i was ready to open my wallet and just be done  too bad the sales staff was unhelpful and a little rude  i asked them very pointedly for help  i knew my daughter would trust their opinion more than mine and they were both wearing those mullet shirts you know long in the back short in the front and well that is just not a style i am able to work with so i did not just want their help i needed their help  they nonchalantly pointed to a section of clothes that she might like  i inquired about help with sizing to which again i was met with no offer of help  she tried on a few things but she was frustrated with sizing and i was annoyed so we left empty handedto be sure this is not my style of clothing but i know there are some school friends that have picked up some cute clothes in here  with all the options available in charlotte and when i am paying fullretail pricing to be fair their retail pricing is affordablereasonable hence 3 stars i expect better and more helpful service  i opened my wallet somewhere else where i got to sit and watch the salesgirls work their magic and help my daughter feel a little special
jCCOxXAfgyX1Vdx_R6UBhQ 3 great place to watch a game  on sundays they have a makeyourown bloody mary bar which is outstanding  they are also cheap 4 i think and also have a mimosa special  i have not eaten a meal here  i have had the pimento cheese dip which was an awful consistency think notalltheway melted velveeta i have seen the wings and had a various assortment of fried bar food  it was all fine  my friends thought the burger was delicious both were suffering from the liquor flu so i am not trusting their judgment 100the service here has never been good  the location works  the back patio is fun has its own bar and the bloody mary bar is fun  this is a place to go and drink not go to eat  and dont be surprised if you have to get your own drink from the bar because your server is no where to be foundmaybe i am just disgruntled  i miss the press box being here
VKPLM1C4fLIVP2wKpwYXeA 3 i love the fillmore  i was between 4 and 5 stars and the reason i went with 4 stars is because i paid 18 on wednesday night for two bud lights and i think that is ridiculous  and i am not a fan of the vip seating they had on the second level for the willie nelson concert it took up way too much room making the venue feel a little overcrowded  these seats were not there for the black crowes or five for fighting and i prefer them not to be there the next time i am lucky enough to take in a show herethe bathrooms are great here which is an added bonus and a surprisethis venue is fantastic for those who love to get up close and for those who want a more intimate setting for a show  really willie was spectacular and i loved the small venue for such a big man  it makes it nearly impossible to think of going to a coliseumarena eventshows often sell out so buy tickets early
jgKMbLlZBl0KgeyaIuGtPg 3 i am a fan of slate interiors  i love the art the unique tables lamps chairs chandeliers home accessories etc there is always something unique here that i want to take home with me  it is the type of place that makes you dream of how you might decorate a beach house a mountain house a contemporary house etc the prices are reasonable on most things  occasionally i feel like the pricing has no rhyme or reasonthey tend to have great midcentury pieces but these move quickly  a lot of their merchandise turns over so it is always a new shopping experience  if you see it and you want it buy it  i have lost several great things because i wanted to think about itthe place is overflowing with wonderful local art  i have noticed these pieces dont seem to sell as quickly as the furniturefor the most part the booths are well laid out with lovely inventory  there are a few that could use a good makeoverthe people who work here are friendly though i did buy an set of something and received a phone call that the price tag on the item was incorrect it was not for both pieces of the pair but had been priced per item  i was told i could either pay the new price or return the items  i opted to return the items and they wanted it back within 24 hours  as this was their mistake and i live across town i thought this was poor customer service  all in all it is in my top 5 places to browse interior goods
8x3RzF1L1w41DLBtYjXA-g 1 i would give zero stars if i could  we hired h  s to install new brackets on our gutters around our entire house we were told they also should have been screwed in rather than nailed and they would do that too  they came did it i paid and they left  only they did not do it  my husband got up on the roof to blow leaves and not one new bracket had been installed  the assumption that i have made in regards to this is they had no idea that i am married to someone who still blows his own leaves and cleans his own gutters and thought that we would never know the work was not done  they have come out to do the job properly
817R6soeZJmYg3YwX-urEA 3 i wanted to love this place  really i did  it is so close to home i was hoping it would be a goto place for my hubs and me  not so muchthe interior is lovely  the water feature is really cool  i love the tile  i hope to find it for a backsplash in my kitchen  yes those are the thoughts that were going through my head as my uninspired meal arrivedthe berry mojito was good  the wine list is nice and reasonably priced  the service was weird  maybe because we were one of only three tables in there on a saturday night but we felt like we were being stalkedseaweed salad great  hard to really mess this up  house salad with ginger dressing ok here is where i show my odd palate i prefer iceberg with my ginger dressing not field greens  but field greens are fancier so field greens is what i got  fine no stars taken off for thisthe rolls spicy tuna a special roll and a few slabs of shashimi  all ok  not wowwonderful not even wow and pricey and small which i prefer but my hub was disappointed  i get that i am paying for atmosphere too  but there was no one there which felt a little creepy  or sad  even our server seemed sad  the atmosphere lovely water feature aside was odd  35 but i rounded down

zLpHu74_eyCZLsHJHuTrAw 3 this is a wonderful place to get lost in one lazy weekend day  their selection ranges from the weird and absurd to vintage and kitschy to antique retro funky cool  unfortunately as of late their selection has not turned over very quickly is dull and uninspired and priced all over the map  there were times when i could not leave without that breathless feeling of finding the perfect treasure you had no idea you needed until you saw it the maze of aisles confusing me with treasures galore all over the store and me not being to remember them all  not so at present  i am hopeful that the spring yard sales and estate sales will breathe some life back into the long winding aisles of the sleepyi have come here for years  i had a booth at their old location and at this location i love the hunt the repurposing of goods the uniqueness that only this type of place can bring into your home i hope this is just a little bump in the road for us  i was there in and out in under an hour this past sunday unheard of  and left without anything not only did i leave with nothing i left not seeing anything that i would buy if only i could free popcorn in the front and some of the nicest sales staff anywhere in charlotte  i will be back and will hopefully be able to rereview my once very faithful bazaarhomegoodsyard art store

nj6I2urM7BnNUUbQ1PWX4g 3 great dance instruction for children and teens  i have one child currently taking tap and ballet here and one who took modern dance  the quality of the instruction is great  the recital is truly spectacular held at queens university it is very exciting and professionally done the studio itself is easy to access behind park road shopping center and sells all the dance shoes leotards and tights they might need at reasonable prices  no running out to morris costume shopthis studio is more pricey than the y but the instruction is more technical and precise  i have done both loved the y but the convenience and the instruction at jami masters won me overthey also do a monthly draft so my scattered brain does not have to remember to pay monthly
egsH7BON_6hqkeJ7umuP3Q 3 this place is huge and full of vendors who have a great eye for fantastic home furnishings and accessories  tons of glassware in right now the new trend is the midcentury mod highball glasses cocktail glasses and cocktail shakers they do not disappoint but they are a bit pricey compared to others i have been scoping outgreat prices on some stuff ridiculous prices on other things this tends to be the case in these multivendor homegoods stores  i used to skip the upstairs as it usually was pretty boring but that area has really gotten gussied up and is worth a peek  they have awesome art work in the stairwell and throughout the store  their signature candles smell wonderfulthe people who work here could not be any friendlier or more helpful  surprise of the store  they have really cute jewelry at affordable prices and have recently added cute scarves as well45 stars but rounded down bcasue they still have a few vendors whose wares are not fitting for this place seems like wasted space
yZDw-hR6TsXtPc2FkoNgEw 1 i have practiced here a lot  not because it is my favorite studio its not but because of the convenience and because of adam w one of the instructors  and shana my other favorite  the classes are often very smelly and i have had to leave when the odor is so overpowering that i was able to taste it in my mouth  the hallway is crowded and annoying both before class and after classes often are so crowded that you are touching your neighbor and getting their sweat drops onto your mat eeekthe crowd is definitelyinteresting  lots of overzealous scantily clad women who stay for more than one class in a row  this is not so much a yoga studio as much as a bootcamplike atmosphere that uses yoga as the tool for your exerciseadam is the consistent exception to the bootcamp mentalityi appear to have a masochist bone in my body because sometimes a good akicking as a workout suits me fine but when i want yoga the exercise the mindfulness the spiritual component experience i go elsewherethey do offer a lot of karma classes which is nicetheir schedule works
J5c7bfRMtIjW9ZdA7DRF8w 3 with a bogo halfpriced sale going on virtually anytime you arrive here it is a bargain  while their prices do seem to be slightly less than dicks the selection is minimal and their kids section is almost nonexistent  so as great of a deal as one might find here it is hard when there is not much merchandise to choose from
m7AstDi2eYVQTHhfRQWAKA 3 i eat here every week for lunch with a lunch group their choice not mine  the lunch menu is changed weekly and always includes pad thai and a curry dish number 4  all can be made vegetarianthe lunch comes with a spring roll and soup  i enjoy both  my favorite meal is when number 4 is green curry with eggplant and green beans  it is spicy bewarethe service can be hit or miss but i can easily order eat and pay within 50 minutes  as a parent i have gotten quite good at scarfing down a mealin the summer this restaurant is hot  and i dont mean hot as in crowded and covered with paparazzi i mean they keep the ac at 78 degrees sit in the main dining room rather than the sunnier side room to keep from completely melting down figuratively and literallysadly the food has declined in quality  what was once a 4 star establishment is now a 3 star restaurant  go get your curry on

zbLNjRcGsjiy4Fkg-_-k7A 3 i am a salon girl but my stylist has always said that barbers are the best trained in their craft  i took my four year old daughter here one afternoon after she insisted for hours that she wanted a haircut  she went in with a hairstyle i would lovingly call birds nest and came out with an adorable and well done bob she did not mind the nofrills atmosphere there was a local anchorman and an elderly gentleman getting their hair did too  oldschool barber with friendly service at a great price 15 without tip and a dumdum lollipop good stuffwe were walkins and did not wait but they did get busier while we were there with people who had appointments
dzriS3mAnZ1ParcHx7pWZw 5 we have used tham a lot and they have never disappointed  they take care of our deaf puppy a big mutt dog a bunny rabbit and 2 chickens for us  they text us to tell us how everyone is doing and leave a lenghty note after each visit  they also water plants and get our mailwe have been thrilled with little friends  they called this morning to tell us one of our chickens was missing she wasnt just has switched coops  i appreciate their thoroughness and the attention they lavish on our petsmuch less expensive than boarding much happier animals too  they also have been wonderful at helping us last minute because fortunately or unfortunately that is how we roll sometimes

MbGCpR5-YaUY_O08YNVzYg 5 dr plonk is fabulous  seriously if you are on the hunt for a pediatrician he is truly amazing providence pediatrics has moved since we started going to them but our loyalty to dr plonk is unwavering and i drive past several other pediatrics offices to get there which admit idly is a pain but his kind bedside manner and his trust in a mothers intuition with his own dose of intuition has worked wonderfully for our family of three daughtershe has called to check in on a very sick child offering to work with our health care provider for inhome nursing care if we got too overwhelmed this all on a saturday  he called every day for a week to check on her and us  he has reassured a desperate mother that her unruly child was just spirited and strong willed  his father was a country doctor and dr plonk has that same genuine care and concern that i imagine and have heard that his father had  unfortunately we have had some medical bumps along the way and dr plonk has helped us navigate through these tough times  beth haynes is also tremendous at this practicedr plonk is 5plus stars and their practice is too
zGH33h9dUfNvbrqvPBumHg 3 i love charlotte yoga  this is a friendly yoga studio without the pretense of some other studios  the instructors are great rowena angie and jaime are my favorites  and when you go to a 5 class not only are you getting a great class but also a great valuethe studio itself is clean and has a lot of natural light streaming in from the floor to ceiling windows which i like during my practice  i feel a little claustrophobic in a hot studio that doesnt have windowsthe bathrooms are adequate well the womens bathroom did not check out the mens with showers  the hall does get crowded during class changes but most studios have this issue  they also have filtered water fill up before you get into classthe power classes that are offered after a hot class are little too hot or i would give 5stars  several times the classes that are advertised as in an 85 degree room have been in a 100 degree  room i check the thermostat because i always wonder if something is wrong with me when my practice seems harder than normal  i have heard several people commentcomplan about this issue  believe me there is quite a difference between 8587 degrees and 100 degreesthis place is overflowing with friendly yogis  my husband who was really intimidated by the whole yoga thing loves this place  my top 2 studio in charlottefriend them on facebook for occasional coupons and discounts
4f6eWCohAq7PO6pQCIgotw 3 unfortunately my family has spent a fair amount of time here and we have always had a wonderful experience although the wait on occasion is unbearable but if you show up with a toddler profusely bleeding while wearing a swimsuit mother and daughter mercifully they usher you back pretty quickly  they were hesitant to stitch up my daughter as the laceration was on her face and they wanted a pediatric plastic surgeon to do it but as she had already had stitches in the exact same spot twice one of those times being at a clinic in a county that did not have a plastic surgeon i assured them that plastic surgery to repair the scar was probably in her future and asked them to sew her up   they were compassionate and kind  i appreciated it immensely  they have diagnosed pneumonia removed a bead from a nose lacerated an infected toe given breathing treatments for asthma etc
4KbJXuf8H2pGQnUatmc1LQ 5 our family of five got the latin combo full rotisserie chicken fried plantains salad yucca rice and beans  all was delicious the salad topped with avocado and dressed with a tangy  read mouthwatering dressing was delicious the plantains were perfect  the rice and beans were fantastic  yucca dipped in the hot sauce divine  my hubs and children devoured the chicken rave reviews even from picky miss  we had leftovers and seriously for a family of five to eat this delicious meal for a whopping 2600 almost made me feel guilty almostwe also had the tostones and guacamole as an appetizer perfectly fried tons of well made guacamole  we may have found our sunday night supper spotsmall interior i would not bring really young or really loud children here
DEsnzui_PkDmiglp3s_fYA 5 great christmas trees and awesome horse drawn carriage ride to the barnthis place is fantastic  we have strawberry picked here gone to the pumpkin patch had a fouryear olds birthday party here  ridden ponies milked cows gone on hay rides made smores and fed sheep and goats these fine people have willed their land and farm to the catawba land conservancy to preserve this lovely 50 acre farm  it is now surrounded by mcmansions but one can truly feel away from it all while hereeasy drive straight down providence roadbtw the bday party was the best most fun and affordable party weve done  strawberry pickin kickball and a pinata  bliss
ybITpT74qBUCw1FJV3Gg5w 3 what is not to love about halfpriced wine on wednesdays  i love the atmosphere here  it is dark and sleek very upscale  the prices reflect thati have eaten dinner here before and while it was delicious it was bit too pricey for what i received  but for a nice bar and some finger foods this is the place  the flat bread pizza with fig arugula and prosciutto is perfect for sharing with a friend  i am not a carnivore so i remove the prosciutto from mine  the crust is crispy the figs are heaventhe salads are also delicious the local heirloom salad is my favorite  i love local foods and this did not disappointthey also have great draft beersnapa cellars chardonnay on wednesdays is 6glass can you say dealthe bar is quiet  a great place to catch up with a friend or to plot revenge on an exboyfriend hers not minethe bathrooms are fantastic  love the faux crocodile floorsawesome outside seatingpark on the toplevel of the parking deck that is attached to southpark mall and it is an easy walk over or valet
7r2k8QHpUUjwzrS94SdZ1A 5 jeffre scott apothecary is a lovely little place full of luxurious lotions and potions makeup and skincare products  this would be enough to earn 5 stars but the real reason i gave jsa 5 stars is because of jeffre and charlton  they could not be any friendlier  and they knew exactly what i needed without me even knowing what i needed  what brought me in was the brow service no wax or sugar or threading here my sensitive skin says thank you   this service is 5 star worthy in and of itself  i think i just gave 15 stars
0L8hqmX03h3CsNvsp4pk6w 5 hands down this place offers the best childrens swim lessons in charlotte and i know because we have tried what seems like all of themthe indoor pool area is great with shower facilities and a locker room that are clean and a good temperature for freezing kids getting out of the pool  the pool is an olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing like at mac but is cool enough for the children not to overheat  the deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction  there are several diving blocks they practice on as well  the seating is great concrete bleacherlike seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall  while the area does have a strong chlorine smell it is nothing like other area ymcas that have the indoor pools and water parks my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave  and while it is warm in there thank goodness it is not sweltering  the parking is awesome here  there is never a crowdok on to the instruction which is great i have enrolled a 4 year old and a 9 year old in this program  my 4 year old could doggie paddle and swim just well enough to jump off the diving board my 9 year old needed a refresher for the swim team and was mostly doing illegal strokes that would get her disqualified in a meet  the lessons are at 6 week intervals which is nice as really longterm commitments freak me out a bit commitment phobe  they are so reasonably prices compared to what we have paid at the stand alone swim centers i almost felt guilty  this guilt increased when i found that my 9 year old was in a class with only one other child the instructor was fantastic  he pushed them enough to work hard but feel accomplished  and he got her strokes totally straightened out no more lifting her head to take a breath in freestyle  we did 2 sessions one 6 weeks the other 5 weeks even better for my commitment issues and my daughter ended up in the all star swim meet after summer swim team  which was a bonus i just did not want her to be embarrassed swimming  the 4 year old  after one 6 week session she was doing a version of freestyle jumping off the diving board and i felt totally safe letting her swim this summer without having to be in the pool with her at every moment  we will be there this winter doing their little winter league swim team  look for us i will be the mom reading her book on the concrete bleachers and my daughters will be the ones splashing around and having a blast
pQ5UfMv2LbPHHor687IXCA 3 as a member of the matilda wong society i felt compelled to review old faithful 300 easti love the atmosphere  who cant be enamored with this old house in the heart of dilworth  i am not sure if she the house is considered a grand dame by historians and architects but it certainly is by me  i love sitting downstairs in one of the booths to the right of the hostess stand for a long leisurely lunch on a saturday that may or may not include a glass of wine  i love coming here in the fall and sitting outside hearing the fountain and looking at the sheep statue  i love coming here in the winter and sitting in the really small and cozy booth in the main dining room  really i cannot think of a time when it isnt right to come herethe hummus plate is a delicious way to start your meal  if you are lucky the white bean and gouda soup will be the daily soup offering it is bowllicking good  all the specials i have ever tried are delicious  but i tend to gravitate toward a salad or my favorite the black bean tortilla with lots of fresh avacado  my hubbie likes the usual a grinderish type sandwich the tuna or whichever pasta is on the menuthere is a special drink here called the matilda wong  and it is very very wong  it used to come in a smallish fishbowl think beta fish but is now served in a small pitcher  when i say it is wong i mean it is strong it is good for sharing but plan on having a responsible driver  they cut you off after 2 as they should  i think i have aged out of the ability to even share onenice wine list halfpriced wine nights  this is a fun girlsnight or date night or parentsareintown place   funny to see your guests reactions to the bathrooms
GNmQhwPNIdWCKHW0RaEGOg 5 at park road shopping center there is a treasure of a furniture and accessory store frequented by designers and consumers alike that is owned and operated by a woman of impeccable taste and friendly demeanor  this place never disappoints lovely furnishings lighting art work pillows etc it is pricey so if you are looking for a deal come during their semiannual clearance sale or check the back where often there is sale merchandisethey fabricate orders and offer design services
BRUaWr8AXP2R5o06yc7ktg 3 my husband and i often stop in here to retox after we detox look for us at the bar in yoga clothes often still glistening with sweat  the pretzel bites and the zucchini fries more like sticks are fantastic  the dipping sauces are great  the boom boom sauce is perfectly spicy i wish i could recreate this at home dinner  i did not enjoy my dinner  get the fried chicken  my husband did enjoy his buffalo chicken sandwich  i had some kind of salad obviously not a great choice in a bar but there veggie selection is limited it was not great but what is great is their brunch  i prefer that to their dinner menu  they also offer bottomless mimosas and bloody marys but good grief who can partake in that at noon on a sunday  not me  if you can stop reading right now and say a prayer of thanksgiving   the french toast the omelet the toast and grits is all greatthey have a good beer selection on tap  what they do not have is a good wine selection this is definitely an area in which they can and should improve  they have several specialty cocktails which usually are good  there bloody marys are delish especially the bloody martin  they have a cute little side room that you can reserve for parties they have also been generous in the community hosting fundraisers of various sorts  their marketing campaign leroy fox for president was awesome  i loved seeing those signs in front yards  free chicken for everyonethis area needed this spot  hotel charlotte had seen its better days and the face lift and the thorough cleaning this spot got is great  even the restrooms arent awful anymore  i wish they had left the train running around the ceilingthis is also a fun place to watch a game

vsgYu7KdwsWnmP8kg8aBYw 5 run to alexander michaels this christmas season for dinner or drinks  you will thank me   tucked away in 4th ward which in and of itself is reason enough to head to am it is quaint and right now decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights i love twinkly things  it truly looks out of a movie  and the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly  a little bit magical  i was a 4th ward resident and kinda lived at am for a few years and had not been in awhile  we went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my alltime favorite venues the fillmore but i digress  great beer selection  we all had different meals nachos are delish salsa not so much my hubs said the burger was good fried pickles yum veggie pita was great but you have to get the what it is  what it is sustained me for years  im veggie now so no chicken for me but it was good all those nightswhile the food is not 5star worthy the atmosphere the bar the beer selection the people and the staff make this a 5star establishment for sure
jQQeiU5PKrUqXD5qy4c-Ug 3 i love the neighborhood theatre it has kept me coming back for years  from the indigo girls to dso the brazilian girls north mississippi allstars and yo mamas big fat booty band to my most recent show the blue dogs and drivin n cryin this is just a fantastic and friendly venue to see and hear a show  it gets loud and it can get crowded very crowded but it is usually a fun and friendly crowd  on occasion you might want to get there early bring a yard chair if you want to grab a general admission seat just put your name on the paper and pen you brought with you and use the scotch tape you also remembered to bring and reserve your seat now head out to grab a bite while you wait for the show to start  seriously it is that friendly but remember your seats wont allow for you to view the show which is great for say a husband who got dragged to see the ig  there are seats upstairs that are sometimes open sometimes included in the ga price and sometimes reserved just check the show listing  there is also a vip seating area that comes with a server  i am fine to get my own pbr or the value cup a big ole in the case of this past weekend sierra nevada  scorebathrooms surprisingly rarely have much of a wait probably because you want to get in and out as fast as you canbut they do have a dyson hand dryer the long one that you take your hands in and out of while hearing a sound similar to a jet engine  this spot is a neighborhood staple and is an anchor to the area  it is truly local business at its finest  it also really helped ramp up the music scene in charlotte
U2j3HMTTIZHMMGR5r1LDeQ 5 i cannot believe i have not reviewed this bakery gem this little slice of heaven the sugary wonder my sweet and reliable suarez bakery  cream horns seriously the flakiest pastry shell sprinkled with powdered sugar and filled full of the lightest fluffiest frostinglike fill  snickerdoodles cinnamon sugar yuminess on top of an elephant ear like cookiepastry  elephant ears a huge treat that is as large as a 5 year olds head reallysugar cookies all shapes and decorations perfectly sweetened to be able to eat several without feeling ill   they also make these to order perfect for school parties that require cookies for decorating and the mom who does not bakecupcakes all different flavors  delicious and lovelycakes tizzerts  need i say more  just the best cake you can put in your mouth our wedding cake was tizzerts and have had several other special occasion cakes from tizthumb print cookies  perfect for the little bit of sweet tooth a small sugar cookie shortbread like cookie topped with a smudge of frosting this is my goto treati do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of my family  so my goto is the thumb print cookie but even without a sweet tooth the temptations of all this goodness cannot be resisted   we celebrate milestones and accomplishments and hard days and completed projects by occasionally popping into suarez and picking out a delectable treat   seriously the made to order cookies have saved me for years as a room mother who cannot bake
pOf1x6FUWY6ncp93xNjHAA 5 i love dr w his name is long and confusing to spell let alone say and this location downtown in the bbandt building next to the caribou bonus  he is very patient and thorough and just a really nice guy  his staff was super helpful in helping me pick out glasses and training me on how to put in and remove contacts which was awful but not their fault  they also filed everything with my insurance company which is greati also love that they call and email to remind of upcoming appointments  i really appreciate this servicethey also have a location on colony rd near the lodgei am a person who hates going to any type of doctor  they really make this a nice experience
d5xLDbIi6vGIDblk8Zk0gA 3 you never know what might be waiting at this consignment store a mirror a chandelier their selection is usually fabulous window treatments or a lamp who knowsthis is a consignment store and not a thrift store the prices reflect thistheir inventory turns over quickly  as a former client and a current customer i can attest to thatthey can be a bit rude or i would give 4stars  i do appreciate and expect friendly customer service as a consumeri have found some unique treasures here so i continue to peruse
Yg_hsgav8dC3HoJYTayZfQ 1 this is the slooooooowest starbucks service in town  due to the convenience of the location i stop in here for a coffee on occassion but i have to have plenty of time on my hands in order to do soparking is tight
lBSfo0CnRUvyBVs9PYLh1w 3 the patio gets 5stars  it is one of my favorites in charlotte  it has plenty of shade for eating brunch outside and it is a lovely setting on which to dine  i usually love their brunch but my food on sunday was not good nor was our service  i had the breakfast pita and i could not eat more than a bite of it it just tasted really bad  and this was weird based on the fact that some of my favorite foods had gon einto its preparation  spinach and cucumber sauce egg and cheese and pita should be delicious  it was not  our water and tea glasses were empty the entire meal and we asked several times for refills to no avail  they do have excellent sangria and a nice wine list  i guess i will stick to my standards  fruit and granola for brunch hummus and cheese plate for appies with wine  the scones that are served before the brunch are divine
0iSp7MGMXhPykRvHEO9oSw 3 what do you send to a mother who has decided to drive four 13 years olds and a 7 year old to florida  how about 4 huge bags of popcorn  hey its not my car  a cheese a carmel and 2 bags of butter should keep them busy for a little while right  if you find yourself in need of popcorn for car trip or slumber party movie night or school function this is the place to get it   no need to call ahead for the aforementioned flavors  they do have fancy flavors but you need to order in advancetip  skip the metal bucket and save 20 by having them put the bagged popcorn in a box
c0YaKp8miTpvVRmQ1qxYqw 3 as other reviewers have mentioned the beer selection is great but no guinness on tap  isnt there a rule about this somewhere  that to be considered a bar with a good beer selection you have to have the real kingofbeers on tap  out of a bottle does not do my guinny any justice  the food is bar food but for a vegetarian it is a terrible selection  the salads are not good  huge but not tasty  my husband liked the wings just fine  too many other places with beer selection and good food for this to my goto bar  or to be a goagain bar
27D7CWE8oo_n96Hcw65lUg 3 the best massaman curry in town  i get it with tofu  my hubs likes the gang dang with chicken  wonderful tea  wonderful servicei love this cozy place in the winter it is so endearingly ecclectic on the inside it is small but not tight it has a great window onto the sidewalk of east blvd it has twinkly lights around said window  walking in here from the cold sitting down to a hot pot of tea and some massaman is a great way to spend a lunch hour but an even better way to spend an eveningthe parking is tight
_kBUPVy8wKyUTSMSRTlz8A 1 ok the atmosphere is fun and festive  who does not like colored lights strewn about and awesome old rock band posters on the walls  the floors were clean and the bar area was fun a great place to meet a friend for a canned beer  yes really  and with a gut washer choice of one chardonnay you will drink the canned beer  or the draft beer but beware the shiner bock was flat and not very cold disappointed party of one  ok ok so you might enjoy a fun atmosphere on a great street to meet friends for drinks  but not dinneri had the fried avocado tacos and the black eyed pea salad  both were bad  the bean salad and i love stuff like this was swimming in salt and vinegar  i think those were the only ingredients  it was bad  the fried avocado tacos as a vegetarian this prospect sounded delicious to me were ummm tasteless which might be better than the black bean salad which might have benefited from being tasteless  the queso was good  but seriously who cant melt some cheese  i like food too much to return here
MqTTA2Rjyv869IzwoX5ytg 3 i love this precious little spot  birds and turtles owls snakes frogs butterflies what is not to lovethey will get the snakes out on request for you or in my case my children to hold  they will also get the skunk out  apparently they are a lot like cats and i must admit my curiosity got the best of me and i did find myself stroking the coarse hair of the injured animal  the butterfly garden is a wonder  we also found turtles hidden in there  my younger 5 yo loves the puppet showsthe staff is so friendly and knowledgeable the little play area gets crowded and lots of inattentive mothers can create quite a bit of mayhem we usually skip this areabring sanitizer as little hands seem to find their way into the turtle water  eeekonce we are finished here we walk on the nature trail to freedom park for picnic fun and play time  we usually look for the grumpy old troll who lives uinder the bridge as we cross into the parkthis is a great way to spend the day
g03YSyEswJF3XOVbJqe3QQ 5 the best beef kebab ever the meat is so tender and juicey  just be careful not to touch the bottom of the metal skewer when it arrives  its super hot make sure to also order the garlic sauce and red meat sauce for dipping its a warm atmosphere with a very friendly staff ive gotten many friends hooked on this place 55
1_ntTyrsYYYAy41nm3UD3Q 1 extremely disappointingthis place had been on my totry list for a while now i came with three friends on a saturday night when it was not too busy i ordered the beef ribs 1650 with a side of potato salad 400 my friends ordered the pork ribs 1600 along with a few appetizerswhat bothered me about the service was that they just sort of drop the food off at the table to no one in particular ideally the server should place the dish in front of the specific person who ordered it or at the very least ask okay who ordered the soandso and place it in front of whoever answers also delivery should be simultaneous two of my friends got their dish and me and the fourth friend waited 15 minutes after that for oursfor 1650 i received two beef ribs with barely any meat on them in my opinion ribs should be falloffthebone these were the exact opposite and the flavour was nothing special my friend was even more disappointed with his pork ribs and sent them back in exchange for the pulledpork sandwichfirst time in a very long while where i tipped less than 15
5-yR9ZRd02OZFQwICwV3Kg 1 ridiculous the hostess seat us down with a major attitude because we asked to seat on a booth she throw the menu down on the table and did not speak a word to us after that we waited 20 mins for a server to come to us the services there was absolutely terrible if you want your night ruined then go there the food was cold when it came out
ls8MhHG2EkUW6RB2-ZLbtA 5 brio is always a happy dining experience  for this specific location ive only been for happy hour but i dont see how their regular menu would differ from their location at town square  their happy hour must be one of the best  they have a list of items for 295  dont let the price fool you though  their portions are decent sized  we always order one of everything and maybe even two of some other things  dont judge us  how could you not though  cheap good food is so hard to pass uptheir service is always amazing  they check several times to make sure everything is okay and refill drinks before it is necessary
YA5W9vlM8fk3bNsJeXCITw 1 a couple girl friends and i ventured over for lunch on our break between classes  one of the girls heard from some of her friends that this place was soooo good  well these friends of hers have either really low standards or just dont know the difference between good quality food and junkall of us ordered the shoyu ribs ramen  to say that it was disappointing would be an understatement  the soup was lukewarm at best and it tasted almost sweet  ramen is supposed to be savory so the sweetish soup was a major nono  the noodles were also sad  it tasted like the instant stuff  gross  supposedly their other menu items ie gogi beef stuffed waffles are supposed to be better but that is a chance that i am not willing to taketheir decorationsfurnishings were quite interesting  the first thing we noticed upon walking in was their transformerlike chairs  they had some anime characters painted on the wall and had some anime showmovie playing silently on a tv  the place was insanely dark that we were blinded when we were walking outside to leave  it goes without saying that i definitely will not be going back  i much rather eat panda express on campus
UHyP7y4t-mZ6tmq_lFZpwA 5 five guys ftw  this place is pretty amaaaazing we usually get the bacon cheeseburger i order the little since two patties on the regular would be too much for me  i love the free toppings you get which include grilled mushrooms and onions  i always  order mine with extra mushrooms as i am a mushroom feign  they also pile on the bacon which is awesome since most places gimp you on that  their bacon cheese dog is also delicious  i just wish they had sport peppers  oh well you cant win them all  their cajun fries are also a must  im not a big french fry fan especially the thick cut kind but the fries here are to die for  the cajun fries are extra addicting which is probably why they have such generous portions  this place does not fail to disappoint and has grown to be our goto place for burgers
6TbQQWS01lVfXpiDL9GK2Q 3 this used to be our go to for buffets  the boyfriend and i decided to try it out when they first opened and found that we enjoyed the predivided portions  mind you not everything was like that  there were also food served the traditional buffet way  apparently you either love this particular serving style or you hate it  we loved it  food and service quality were definitely up to par  they have a variety of food and have choices available that arent your typical buffet fare  they also have a mac and cheese bar which i loved since i am a mac and cheese feign  i think the thing i enjoyed most was the desserts  im not a big sweets person so i chose the french macaroons and the white chocolate dipped crab apples and strawberries  however for the people with a sweet tooth they have a variety of gelato fudge cakes and whatever else  unfortunately weve heard that the food isnt the same as it was before so we havent been back  they also raised their prices it used to be 29 i think  its now 35 which is a bit steep if im not guaranteed amazing food
aNZJwHFhErxEy6Mw5TUsoA 5 i grew up in glendale and i have always loved cerretas candy i think the cerreta family has put a lot of thought into the variety of their product offering and to ensure the highest quality of their ingredients i feel that the candy itself is a testament to another time the shape size and taste transports me back to a time even before my youth  i time i never knew but always imagined as better somehoweven though some of the presentation of the products and dcor may seem dated i sincerely feel that it is all part of the charm of this family owned business i now live on the east coast and try to swing by the store whenever i am in town to grab a box of french mints for my office and get a few free samples while im there its always a hit with my coworkers i also like picking up the individually wrapped candies from time to time  i find the factory store to have much more variety than the grocery store chains that also carry cerretas products around town i have found this location to have a few more modern candy offerings such as peanut butter truffle and mint cookie crumble everything is excellent here and if you are in the area you should swing by life is short what are you waiting for
rsZQTvCkoVloY7i5M_DQtA 5 i grew up in glendale and my parents would have friday pizza night where we would get take out from pullanos i now live within proximity of manhattan and have access to really great pizza i try to swing by pullanos when i am back in town and i have to say that that the pizza still holds up after all of this time its nothing like the new york style pizza but its always really good they have a thick crust with a house made tomato sauce that at times can be on the sweet side they have a tendency to overdo it with the cheese but it still comes together well i think its a testament to the fresh ingredients overall the menu is expansive and does not disappoint see you guys next time i am in town
p2WnLi7Tj-2x9rqSOwHERg 1 anyone looking to have their yard landscaped by this company watch out this place is horrible to deal with and has no communication skills my job was pushed back for weeks and nothing was communicated to me on top of that i am now having to report them to my bank as fraud since they have yet to return the upfront money i gave them horrible horrible experience all the way around i wouldnt even give them 1 star but that is the lowest it would allow me to select i just hope my bank is able to get the money back soon from these rat bstards
kshbZ29ZiPtlDOyixi8Gjg 5 awesome price came here for our anniversary got a discount great room always clean inside the hotel is he most amazing bakery and garden must see close to everything watch fountains outside your window free parking and great scurity loved it
d_I9gHDXtJ987wL1joF_Gw 1 terrible they advertise the bar stays open till 12am but in our whole stay when we arrived back after dinner usually before 11pm  the place was all locked up the hotel is under renovation too so dont expect the famed ritz service for the medium futureok next night gets even better we arrive back at 1030 and guess what  bar closed no problem we order drinks in our room and they send us macaroni and cheeseall this for a mere 400 a night
HhNBPMGbBQnJeqTsi_V5uw 1 it was horrible the soup tasted like it came from a can you can tell its frozen food the prices are good but you get what you pay for i gave it 2 stars only because the staff was outstanding think ill pass on this place in the future
UC2474KYTL2DP1wR6qwvFQ 3 food was very good but service is below par wasnt crowded at all but still took forever for someone to seat us just a person yelling across the room telling us someone will seat us soon i recommend it for the food but dont be in a hurry to be seated

mIyMereUwhex_nDr63YOAg 1 went in looking for a good knife as an xmas gift got talked down to by the fatbalding guy behind the counter son of the owners saying the good knives which were fully within my expressed budget were for higher class people even mentioning every few minutes that all the kitchen stuff was final sale and he didnt want me thinking about a refundthis literally happened a few hours ago ive been there in the past but unfortunately never had the pleasure of interacting with the lovable son

oDyR6JoXffJap50oGIZuMw 5 dufferin park is one of the top parks in toronto there are plenty of old grove trees that provide shade for the playground area but there are also sunny fields to spread out a blanket for sunning or a picnic the organization that runs this park does an outstanding job of holding unique family events like puppet shows and movies it has a rink a wading pool a pizza oven fire pits a gigantic sand boxfor a kid it really doest get better than this park

r6GdPfGtXbcEud4-iIdiGA 5 the salomon salad for lunch was simply the best food i have eaten for 11 bucks  the service was fantastic  sometimes i wonder if people who complain about bad service receive bad service because they are not the friendliest people themselves  i also was here for a grooms dinner and there wasnt a complaint in the party  my beef tenderloin was awesome
lbkNRnKXFAEQmSBPDxo7Jw 5 twisted fitness is a special place  the instruction is world class and the teamcommunity built around it is incredibly positive  i started jujitzu a year and a half ago with no previous martial arts experience  since then this schoolgym has become one of the most important aspects of my life  twisted has challenged and pushed me in ways not comparable to any gym i previously attended if you are looking to get in shape learn to defend yourself and expose yourself to the beautiful sport of jujitzu there is no better place to join  my previous sport was tennis so please dont think you cant try jujitzu
cAMTFx8iwWM1z0PT8KINGw 1 i tried to get a home loan here and they never got back to me  anchor bank down the road was happy to help  disappointed that my home town bank didnt take me seriously

xx0JXNPadRM82XR-_UBOWw 5 all aspects of the experience exuded high quality and care  the food service and atmosphere were unique thoughtful and added to the great dinner i had  great addition to madison
ODriYcxb0OQv4oUrN54TJA 1 my wife and i came here trying to diversify our restaurant portfolio  food across the board was okay  lettuce a little brown rolls very out of bag from store feeling  many things lacked flavor when the creative names and combos made me expect something bold  im not sure what some of the yelpers liked so much   the snickers pie was blah  my salad was plain  my wifes quiche was like a frozen pot pie i liked my app but not so much id order it twice  the only thing we like was our butter finger shake but madison has a few thousand places to get custard  our server was nice and helpful but lacked courage in guiding our selection  not a awful experience but not very good  would not give 2nd try
3rm8lrS9uTC24UP2JuujLw 1 cleanliness inconsistent  price high for some low for others  equipment all over the board  basketball crowd  the eastside location is not friendly carpet in locker room is just not right   better options in town
mlhp9_Qpr_KKEcRB-uohrQ 3 good  not great  very consistent and attentive service  if you need sushi and a seaweed salad it is the place to go
wg8wrJE1e5y17F56jv8KNw 1 i have been here a few times with an okay experience  today i ordered 3500 worth of food for 2 people and toddler  one order was flat wrong and needed 2 sausage patties added to the plate  i kindly pointed the mistake out  pointed to the menu which supported my claim and she declined to make it right  the person behind me then told her she was wrong and she correct my order  i left and went back to eat my food with no resolution to the issue  then the front desk girl brought out the carbon copy and told me why i was wrong while my two year old is having a meltdown  i then told her i didnt want to argue and asked her to leave   5 min later as we left the sausage showed up and no boxes  requested 2 times were brought to our table  go to crema and support good service and food
OSGkpByQp38wi1DIfuig7w 5 this is one of the last real service stations left in madison  the guys at this place are the type you build a relationship with and they take care of you  i recently had a quote for my truck that was quoted other places for 1500 to 2000  they worked their magic for 600  the next day when grabbing gas for my boat and jet skis  no corn gas available here i had a lock on my trailer that was jammed  they cut it off and told me to have a nice day  no charge
5kMnY9eUsskyknVszeqWQw 5 one of the best experiences i have had in vegas  food drink decor outdoor patio and vibe  the chicken and waffle sandwich was great

ETnHErkDD0waB7DXKqxirw 3 its good  i thought it was on the right track   everything was solid  deviled eggs chick sandwich and komboocha tea nothing blew my mind  ill go back and see what the evening vibe is like  glad to have it in the neighborhood
hNAith0lrpt9DTM1iEESaw 3 i want to start out by saying im going to give this place a second try for sure  but if my yelps arent honest they dont mean anything   so here we gothe space and view is excellent  great vibe and view  the problems started with my order   i ordered the quiche of the day and sat down   15 min pass and they came to my table and said they were out of what i ordered   i switched to whats left no problem  another 15 min passed and i went to the front and they told me it was a very busy day and that it was almost ready  it was less busy than an average lunch rush at most places i have been in town when i finally got the quiche it was cold and blah   i hope to try again and experience what everyone is talking about  it stands on 3 stars for being a cool hang out
0IDsjVimXLlaY_wKUL3ZEQ 3 good local shop  i havent experienced any racism like jayson and can safely say after long conversations with a very interesting owner that they are not a racist bike shop  madison maybe a bit on the hypersensitive side when pulling the race card
-5LANRkGm8Y8SRCUdbE0Bg 5 chef dave plus an amazing atmosphere equals my favorite spot in the 608  huge beer list and great fish fry never had a bad experience
caHQiDwI7N9GyFRfOeOk5Q 1 im no sure if we got a bad box or notbut these are the most disgusting pastries i have ever had four of us shared a mixed box and sampled each one everyone of us gagged one person spit the lemon from the lemon meringue across the room this will haunt me for years
dcva2qGxSqvn5iwSOBzvHA 5 jeffs show was hilarious it was the highlight of my weekend in vegas jeff engages the audience throughout and is simply very funny i laughed for the entire hour performance his juggilng isnt bad either i would absolutely see this show again and highly recommend it for all ages his opener turf was also fun to watch and his crew was awesome

jKaehzMhYR5ztghbdcfWIQ 1 i brought in two cats to get groomed today they were extremely nice fast to book however when i got home i noticed a huge amount on them and they werent finished drying i expected one of the cats to still have shedding however the other cat  gets groomed regularly i noticed that they were using furminstors which i have been told isnt good for cats because it just pulls out more hair i got home and brushed my normally groomed cat and ive never seen her so bad i think they just pulled out the hair without trying to brush it out im unfortunately disappointed i will be going back to petsmart they did have a challenge with the other cat however because of the amount of hair she looked like a different cat when finished however in the past taking my other cat to get groomed i can pet her without getting lumps of hair or not seeing loose hair
bvQjQ2hypECMPEmqjBNkcA 1 if i could give negative stars i would  their pizza is not that great go get yourself a five dollar pizza for better taste  they mess up your order and when you go to call to get it fixed they tell you i really dont care sweetheart  dont waste your time unless you like shitty food and liked being insulted with it at the same time
tS-Yzg6ptY3jKsufVWc_9w 5 i absolutely love this place  by far the best salon ive ever been to  yes its pricey but they disclose all the charges to you before they start their work  ive been screwed over multiple times by hair salons but they are very honest upfront about their prices  i spent a lot on my hair but i was also box dying it for several months which they had to correct and i didnt have a hair cut in six month prior to coming here  jenn did my hair and she did an excellent job  some may not like that there were passed off to different people but i didnt mind it at all it gets things done much faster  the essentials are done by the person you are originally set up with  i bought a lot of product which i was given an awesome discount on and jenn put some of the red hair dye in my conditioner while sending me home with gloves as well  i dont care what anyone else says i would totally recommend this place
S0ureIixZBkhCvbrtntGdQ 3 decent place to go only reason i give it five stars is because of the prices  during happy hour rolls as low as 275 i had three and found myself fulltaste like any other sushi placei subtracted a star for the attitude i received from the servers  one however was extremely nice and made sure my cups were always fullwe walk in i wanted to sit in the back and the woman who seated us had us sit where an employee was eating and kicked her out of the seatright in front of us  i felt extremely uncomfortable and felt bad  then as we sit down a man came out and said something to the waitress and looked at us and said you took my table  i almost wanted to walk right then and there and say oh okay here is your table well go where they welcome their fucking customers  but didnt  i told the woman that we could sit at the table next to us and not have anyone moved or their table taken  her response we need that for the bigger parties  that table remained unoccupied the entire time we were thereif their prices werent cheep and the sushi wasnt decent i wouldnt have been back 
cWKz6xtgzgTE4GyqmMMYBw 3 im not sure why there are so many negative comments i had a good experience here  the main reason i tried this place is because of the location only being about 5 minutes away from my house  christina did my nails extremely helpful and nice  she took her time to get me the the exact color i wanted talked to me and offered me a drink  i went in an hour before closing and the receptionist was afraid i wouldnt be able to squeeze in a pedicure but christina was fast and efficient to make sure i had enough time  another woman i forgot her name   did my pedicure when everyone was already packed up and ready to leave so i really appreciated that  it seriously was the best pedicure ive ever had all the tough skin i had on my feet gone  a lot of people complain about the laziness of the owner but i didnt see him fooling around  a nail ladys phone was going off and he was attentive to put her ringer on silent and sorting through the receipts with the receptionist only downsidethe owner of the place was there today and a bit standoffish  i wouldnt say rudebut not friendly  he interrupted my pedicure to have the lady check a yelp review im assuming because it was regarding a complaint and it was in a different language she could understand  i didnt mind but it seemed unprofessional  he kind of was staring at me so i just said hello and he ignored me  i would have given it five stars  however i work in an office and a lot of ladies ask about my nails since im constantly working with my hands and i will recommend this place and christina
aBOLg1RFvpDeCAKdPO4Rfw 1 if there was an option to give this place negative stars i would  first of all you walk in and even in the dining area wreaks of smoke  so you push that aside thinking your steak will be good enough to bare the smell  nope ordered a medium rare still tough as nails  i ordered one drink the same exact drink i ordered at tex mex down the street a smaller portion for literally double the price  tex mex 500 this place 1000 for a vodka and seven up in a smaller glass  then i asked for a side of ranch charged me for it  this place is ridiculous  what are you gorden ramsy steakhouse  get out of here your food sucks so dont charge me extra for ranch to try and get the leather tasteless steak out of my mouth
9c6nf4kocK1pWo8k67L8fg 5 best vet ever we drive all the way from mountains edge just to update our cats on their vaccines because we only trust him
6amCsEd7iyyyh6_ZPnMlqg 1 if you want your ice cream served by rude bitches by all means go here  i went in with my fiance and friend after eating at the thai restaurant a few feet away  the three of us walk in my fiance wanted a peanut butter shake  we dont have peanut butter ice cream but we can put peanut butter in the shake what kind of ice cream do you want he ordered the chocolate malt ice cream  then i order then my friend goes to order and as sammy the leader on duty walks out my friend goes to tell her what he wants but instead is told oh shell help you when shes done and helps the person after him  i dont know maybe im not sure how a line is formed and serviced but i thought it was on a first come first serve basis but apparently at cold stone its every other person in linewho knew  anyway my fiance goes to try his shake and low and beholdno peanut butter  he goes to the register and just simply asks can you add peanut butter to my shake  sammy looks at the ice cream scooper who took our order and asks did he ask for peanut butter she says no  seriously little girl  we were all there we had a discussion about not having peanut butter ice creamhow can you try and manage this lie  so as im explaining to this girl to try and refresh her memory about our ordersammy rudely interrupts and says well its going to cost more to add peanut butter  we all just looked at each other shocked and the girl who took our order stated my bad as if she really thought that was a proper apology  wow  so we all walked out i will not be coming here again just because im worried for my well being  i wanted to throw my fiances shake at sammy aka leader on dutys head for being such a rude brat  if they were a little bit nicer and actually acted like they cared because i dont knowthats your job working in customer servicei wouldnt be so bitter about it  if any of you ladies are reading this please remember you arent going to get too far with that kind of attitude with anything you do in your career 
zPRRy6tQZQEAP46IGQn_8Q 3 ive been waiting for live market to open for a while from the moment i saw the familiar live sign appear in liberty village ive been waiting they opened in the week i was out of town visiting family so for a week i watched from a far watching my friends post pictures of the various things they had bought and ate  looking forward to being back in my hood of libertyniagara so i too could eat this stuff toolive market is conveniently located right near my gym so i have been here three times in a fairly short time period and its nice to have such a great postworkout option and really extra nice to have a close nonstarbucks coffeetea option near my houseboth times ive actually ordered food its been very very tasty first time  the chickpea burger second time upon the recommendation of the server  burdock burrito do order this it is yummy live market also keeps me in silk road earl grey tea ive had the wherewithal to arrive shortly before the influx of liberty village work folks coming in on their lunch breaki often feel like the best way to tell the service level of a restaurant is how they handle minor errors my partner ordered and ended up waiting a fairly long time for his lunch order so not only did they make it right they apologized and offered him a coffee for his trouble smooth empowered staff make me a happy camper so we just left liking them even moretheyve got ezra pound roasted coffee and prepared readytogo items juices snacks and treats as well as orderin items if you have a little more time there are lots of locally made products like chocosol chocolate stasis preserves bunners cookies sweets from the earth treats amongst other things you can buy protein powder tea coffee and even make up they also have jars of rawtella for sale which i wouldnt call healthy but i would call really really delicious since i did end up buying some on my last visitservice has been consistently friendly food has been consistently good and i feel like i get good value for my money when i go therethings to know they dont have debitcredit working yet but its coming soon ie at the moment its cash only
KPfapMni5c1zXRA5az3wOg 3 like most vegos i was a little sad when fressen announced they were closing not because i particularly liked it but because it was the main option for a slightly fancier totally vegan night out with wine the other tasty option being vegetarian haven without winea group of 7 of us went on their second day is it too early to do a review maybe so take it all with a grain of salt i hear things are still evolving and the menu might change more desserts might appear anything could happen the bar snax menu looks interesting and the idea of being able to have drinks and vegan snacks at midnight or 1 am is promising especially with bar chef next door which has zero veganizable food options at all according to the last time we wentthe grasslands interior and drink menu is the biggest change when compared with fressen and those are really nice improvements its brighter while still being intimate and has a more open feel with less cramped seating another pleasant change is that the servers all seem friendly and generally helpfulfood is very fressenlike so if you liked fressen you will like grasslands i had a favourite goto dish at fressen  i ordered the skewer and liked it everyone else ordered the seitan roast or the chicken bar snax menu is the biggest change from the former and its full of crispy and bite sized optionsmajor problem on our first visit was that we went in a group of 7 which means an automatic gratuity of 18 was added to our bill but there was nothing on the menu to indicate this the person taking our reservation didnt let us know and the servers didnt mention it since were decent people we obviously added a tip and so double tipped womp wompill leave out the facebook page drama that ensued after we commented about it on their page but regardless they did not handle the comments well and shut off posting on their page entirely hopefully it was an educational experienceto sum it up food is okay service is good bar and associated menu is great interior is great
xjUv6EeU_6wRbfmoW_oxoA 3 since this place is one of the indie coffee passport stops i skipped buying my typical latte and ordered a vegan soup instead i asked the server if the bread that came with it was vegan too and he said he didnt think so now this is the part i really liked he quietly gave me a bit of a discount on the soup which is normally 395 i thought that was a nice and unexpected touch he was very friendly in general and asked me how my soup was when he walked by later i wish they got their vegan baked goods from somewhere other than omg baked goodness because i cant support that place at all please get some sweets from the earthits got free wifi yeyit charges extra for soy milk booothe soup was decent the first bite was kind of oddly sharp and unpleasant but by the end of it i was really enjoying it so i think id probably order it again
ovXJotrA7x7kq8MyaIfEvA 5 today i successfully made a pillowcase im so proud i had to tell yelp but seriously i love this little store and im sad that it took me so long to visit but i anticipate visiting more frequently in the futurei took the basic sewing essentials class on a whim and now i cant wait to take more the classes are small just 6 people and easy to follow the instructor was helpful with good advice on troubleshooting machine problems threading issues and other sewing machine stuff i left feeling like i had learned something that i could actually do again without  being confused karyn the owner was our instructor and came around regularly to check on everyone and offer help or advicethere is a store dog and initially that was weird but in a good way i usually dont like dogs but this one is laid back friendly but not too friendly and spent most of her time on the couch in the back the fabric selection is awesome so many different colours and textures they have fat quarters in various styles and colours notions patterns and other suppliesreally positive experience and i would recommend it if youre looking for fabric or if youre looking to start taking sewing classes
GBDHc0_hT12_PvM8NONBaQ 1 their vegan delight wrap has havarti cheese in it you suck itz a wrap will not return ever and apparently theyve had the sign up since at least last yearid give it no stars but its not an option
sQlDlTNl8qSciIUQOzFdUw 5 i ordered a soy latte and it was perfect just a perfect cup the flavour was so smooth and delicious i walked in mid barista banter which was pretty entertaining and while the space is really small i managed to come in when it wasnt too busy and got a seati really want to try the siphon coffee sometime
ezMtw-e85E-GPHAMAUQiIA 3 i dropped into this wine bar for surprise a glass of wine i had checked out their menu online earlier but opted not to order anything solid though they do have a couple of small veganish optionseight has a modern decor good atmosphere and while i was there a live dj there were television screens in the wall playing oh so hipply distorted alfred hitchcock movieswhen i walked in it was mostly empty the bartender was friendly and the service reached that delicate balance of attentive but unobtrusive i ordered a terrible wine the name of which i have forgotten but thats not their fault i picked something local and cheap they have a great wine list available by the glass or by the bottle so youre bound to find something to enjoythe server was kind enough to keep offering to fill up my glass of water at least 5 times after i finished that 1 glass of terrible wine they werent exactly busy but there wasnt a moment i felt rushed out of there and it was appreciated
H9BpJnQ9Zy90Ib6qGA3DZw 3 the first time merchants of green coffee was recommended by a barista at another coffee shop i put it on my mental to visit list she had mentioned that it didnt look like a place you could go inside and drink coffee so i was slightly more prepared for the remote location but i still got lost on the wayunfortunately the day i went in they had run out of regular soy milk and considering ive been ordering a soy latte from everywhere that was a bit of a disappointment they dont have soy milk so one of the baristas happily suggested 2 im not sure how thats an equivalent option but obviously i didnt go for itluckily there was someone else there and he offered me a very awesome tasty latte made with so nice soy creamer which is a lot thicker than regular soymilk he warned me it might be too sweet but no it was delicious and a great cozy cup of coffee and now i kind of wish people always made me lattes with that heavy soy creamerwandering through their location is a bit like visiting a mini coffee museumid like to go back again and try just a regular coffee from merchants of green coffee or take one of their coffee workshops after ive completed the rest of my indie coffee passport stops
51L4yFwq6KKV7VdAxrG_bw 5 i had a great experience at the wind store todayhonestly the store was a madhouse when i got in there were over a dozen customers inside and 45 customer service agents in the storebut i waited only around five minutes to talk to someone and in a little over 15 minutes i was set up with a new account with the plan i wanted at 50 off for 6 months and a new phone on windtab daniel s was super helpful gave me all the pertinent info i needed answered my questions and hooked me up with a phone number i might actually be able to remember everyone working in there seemed friendly and approachable so thats a plusthat is what customer service should be like overall i was really satisfied with the customer service i recieved and so far the coverage has not been an issue for me i havent seen wind away at all yet surprisingly enough i can use my new phone in places i couldnt use my rogers phone like the elevator in my office building
1zEqp7KhU1xZUvhccddtDg 3 once upon a time we came here for a birthday party there were around ten of us and wed reserved a spacemusic seemed subtle enough and i liked their selection of drinks and vodkas staff was polite and friendly but it was difficult to actually order as we were left alone for long stretches of time most drinks were delicious some were total flops at least for my palate  if we come back here again ill be sure not to feel too experimental
jk9POXdfBbBfLTjgO8YFFg 1 i guess im not excited about this place because for me it not only has limited options it doesnt actually have a good option the juicy vegan is one of the most expensive items on their menu and when i ordered it the woman at the counter asked me if i want sour cream or cheese and i ask well is it vegan sour cream or cheese to which she replies no its not included  dear restaurants if you have something labelled vegan on the menu could you let your staff know what vegan actually means thank youwe waited about 20 minutes to get our orders after i picked out the big tasteless spears of tofu out of my not so juicy  juicy vegan it wasnt so bad i liked the diversity of vegetables it was an ok size but id probably opt for big fat burrito or burrito boyz instead of going to this place againmy friend ordered the special of the day which was a korean bbq burrito and his reaction was equally meh i wanted to like them because i love burritos and im nearly always in the village but it just didnt happen
_CL0bKkhbgXcLGyfefArhA 3 like the crema coffee co on bloor the soy latte i ordered from here was delicious though if youre expecting coffee art you might not get it i certainly didnt but luckily that doesnt really matter much to methey baristas are friendly helpful and competent and when i bought an indie coffee passport here one of them had a few suggestions for other places on the list to visit which was extremely helpful and im looking forward to taking advantage of her coffee wisdomthere are adequate outlets well okay there are six and i got one so for me thats adequate  for us computer folks fast free wifi and places to sit i noticed one gluten freevegan option in the collection of sweet baked goods at the counter hopefully they improve the selection on that front though people looking for gluten free or vegan baked yumminess with their coffee can just cross the street like i did and grab something from bunners bake shop my only complaint is that they normally charge extra for soy milk but i avoided that issue by using the indie coffee passport
K8rhK9yIKeQxNb72ILiTjw 1 i finally went to kings cafe after it was recommended to me by a lot of other peoplei had sampled some of their very delicious appetizers at the vegetarian food fair last month so i was excited to try an entree well i had the soy fritters with curry rice and i dont know if it was just the wrong dish to order or what but i didnt think it was very good fried tofu gluten fritters with carrots potatoes beans and cauliflower sounded so yummy but it wasntthe only thing i really enjoyed the flavour of was the potatoes because they seemed to have taken on the most of the curry flavour the veggies and soygluten stuff werent very flavourful i needed some hot sauce for sureat least it was on the special order menu so it was only 599 some of the other items were 1013they also wouldnt let me plug in my laptop and were generally kindof rude so eh not very enthused
IIrkRcw2i95xsm3yUH57Zw 5 you know its been two years since my first review of this place and often places start strong and then fizzle a little sometimes i expect that quality will go down or the atmosphere might change not this placei straight up love boreal gelato they have veganfriendly gelato in interesting flavours today they had chocolate salted caramel and coconut fruit based  sorbettos are great and all but these were extra exceptional creamy rich and just all around delicious i know flavours rotate but i havent yet tried any flavour of their nondairy gelatos that wasnt tastythere is ample seating inside and a little area outside to sit on service was quick and friendly go there
UZEvglRhpX_bQNM59mvsyw 5 ive been going to the depanneur nearly once a week for a few months they have a casual atmosphere and are generally a good venue to find local food stuffs corner store by day dinner establishment by some nights its really a great spacethe dropin dinners are usually why we end up there once a week or more whenever they have a vegan one which is on the regular its always something different but it has been consistently delicious the chef stylings of len who i think is the owner cooking something up every tuesday emily z or kalmplex and many others make this place just a total hidden gem that i kind of dont want to tell anyone about because i want to keep it to myselfas people have mentioned sign up for the newsletter on their website or connect with them on facebooktwitter to keep up with the events they have going on there is always something for everyone the house made sodas are totally delicious elderberry blackcurrent maple lemonade just to name a few they also have coffeetea apple cider and soy milks packaged foods include local mushrooms jams and jellies ketchup made in house and freshly baked buns and breads often with glutenfree options as well soups milks yogurts and other small business produced productsthere is wifi there is table space and the service is always friendly its like a home cooked meal in the best possible waythings to know cash only there is an atm available at the convenience store across the street
rVVXd7jcyQnjf-nhKdpzRw 3 i love this little place off churchthis place has  three varieties of sorbetto that are vegan and delicious i love getting a scoop of mango and a scoop of the lemon the lemon is amazing sure variety is limited but what they do have is fantasticthe service has been consistently friendly everytime and there have been many times ive gone in with friends the interior looks great and its nice to be able to sit out on the patio if its decent outplus they have a beautiful selection of chocolate that ive never tried but it looks great
z30pqS3yP2z3iiHV3unFLg 5 i loved this hotel high ceilings and a spacious stylish room i kept telling my partner i like this i like this and then thisclean lines hyper modern rooms with a split shower where if an interested party wanted to voyeristically watch you bathe they could do so while laying on a very comfortable bed and if you arent so keen on goose down they have alternate bedding available upon requestthe service was stellar more towels 5 minutes youre swimming in towels you want a ride to the train here is our fancy audi well take you over you want free wifi here you go you want to come back to a room with a bottle of ice wine soft music and lit up by little floating candles no problemthe included continental breakfast wasnt bad either not the vegan friendliest of places obviously but they had fruit coffee jams peanut butter and diy toast your own bread station they have almond milk sometimes  but not during the time we were there but i appreciated that the server tried to hunt some down for mei loved all the little details  i also loved how close it was to the metro and bixi stands art galleries and copious amounts of patios
lEwYfkqQEPfvUs-0inB2-w 3 i had a terrible latte here bitter weak foam and unexciting maybe it was a bad day to go in since i walked in on boxing day and it was one of the only open cafes i might give it a do over after im done with the rest of my indie coffee passport stops but im not in any rushi enjoyed the space itself though that wide open emptiness my table was covered in magazines so if you dont bring reading material youre more than covered they have wifi and i read and finished a book without interruption its quiet id probably go back eventually buy a coffee i might not even like solely to hang around maybe thats why there isnt much seating there is a certain dark homey comfort to this place i cant quite put my finger on but i like itwhile im happy they offer soy and almond milk i dont like that they charge extra for it
nUOZFEJtFnlcve_5s8DwVg 3 i went for my first ever float yesterday evening and i really liked it staff at float were super friendly and helpful and offered me a nice peach tea while i waited for my turn to go in it was very relaxingive been getting a few questions about the process so i figured it would be helpful to have some idea of what happens when you walk inso this is what happens when you walk ini had already paid and made my appointment online so i just walked in around 15 minutes before my appointment i signed a release form drank some tea and waited until my turn came a friendly member of the staff showed me to the room i would be using explained a bit about the tank and some advice on ear plugs then he left me alone to do my thing the doors lock so you have some privacyi had the last float of the night so it was 2 hours long but standard floats during the day are around 1 hour  they have 5 rooms each with flotation tanks in them and its easy to make an appointment online which was a major pluseach room has a shower a bench and a flotation tank and a robe towels  ear plugs are also provided they have scent prefloat shampoo  body wash you can use to get ready before going into the tank and a more scented postfloat shampoo and conditionerthe flotation tank has about 10 inches of water and a whole bunch of dissolved salts for max float potential so its easy to get into the tank sit on the bottom close the door lay in the water and then open it again or whatever you feel comfortable with at first i was a little anxious about getting lost into the abyss of the tank and it just seemed to get darker but as i found out its easy to find the door handle in the dark and easy to open it whenever you need to so after realizing it wasnt a big deal and that i could open the door anytime i closed the door and floated away 2 hours without realizing itwhen your time is up there is music that comes on and gets progressively louder to gently wake you or get you out of your relaxed statethere is no right way to do it but i had a great time just floating around with my eyes open enjoying the feeling of gravity mostly disappear and also got some really good stretching in as well just be careful with the salt water as you might expect if you get it in your eyes  it stings but there is a towel with a water bottle near the tank door if you need to rinsethere was only a brief moment in the beginning of my float when i heard a siren from the street otherwise i didnt notice any street noise at all and considering what i saw when i left float last night thats really impressive lots of police activity another ambulance that i hadnt heard im usually pretty sensitive to sound so mostly for me it was nice to have some neartotal quiet and no vibrations other than the sound of my heartbeat for a couple of hoursi think theyve got a great set up and i didnt find their prices high especially when compared with some other float places ive seen in the past and theyve got a variety of options to choose from on their website the one thing that is worth mentioning is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out walking out onto queen street at 1 am on a friday night can be kind of shocking not like this is a surprise of course its loud and busy i know id like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time otherwise i had a really great time
ocMVC0Vguf9tGkpflSqvHg 3 another one of those lovely places that id probably have missed if it were not for the indie coffee passportfirst thing saturday morning i went over there to meet up with nicole h for a minicoffee crawli got there way too early but the moment i walked in i instantly felt comfortable and welcome its the kind of place i could see myself visiting everyday for a coffee very friendly atmosphere the lighting was great and there was ample seating but of course  it was 10am on a saturday morning it was obvious this was a local spot people coming in and out chatting with bob the owner like he was an old friend i ordered my usual large soy latte it was so good thick with a cute three dimensional heart made of crema and i just loved the cup i commented on it in my head and then again to nicole h when she got there it was the perfect size and shape to hold with both of my hands also i was very happy to see they dont charge extra for soy milkother things that are great  they have free wifi when i went in the password was on the chalkboard at the front   there is definitely an outlet at the back corner i didnt look anywhere else but there is at least one there are vegan snacks soups sandwiches in addition to several nonvegan optionscomplaints  none really its a bit out of the way for me but i would go back anyway
qKnZ79iSewkDqTZYzIC_fA 3 we went and saw a movie here on telus tuesday where we got a discounted movie ticket and a free popcorn and a drink the combo ticket was cheaper than buying a regular ticket cant go wrong with that avoiding the massive price of snacks is always niceits close to the osgoode subway station i loved the copious selfserve machines  and the seats were comfy what is with the bathrooms though first of all they were kind of hard to find and secondly for a big theater there arent very many stalls im glad i went on a tuesday in the middle of a movie because i cant imagine what that looks like on a friday or saturday
8I7pohJcQcGWuSXVjClxdQ 3 working in the yorkville area ive come here regularly for lunch i love the location and the interior its a nice break from the everyday and its automatically relaxing calm ignorable music fills the restaurant interspersed with the occasional loud whirring of a blenderi like that there is always a bottle of water on the table because i end up getting a couple litres of my h2o intake for the day while im thereive ordered a bunch of different things but the pad thai was easily and most expensively  my favourite nice filling serving with a fresh rich flavourthe nacho plate is pretty delicious too but as some other reviewers have mentioned dont expect a giant nacho plate portion here its not huge but paired with a meal its a nice snacksmoothies are always thinner than i expect them to be and after ordering it several times youd think id be used to it by now but im not so thats something to be aware of and set less thick mouthfeel expectations overall i like it here i do find it feels expensive especially since there is no guarantee of organic ingredients but service is always good and not intrusiveps get a macaroon or three theyre delicious
XyFCr4BVEbKymURD7dSjKQ 3 i went to here the other day it had a lot of places to sit most of which were occupied free wifi but no power outlets that i could findthe latte i had was beautiful but not super exciting flavourwise ive been spoiled entirely by the sam james espresso bar the one from here was probably the second best one ive had in the city so far thoughit seems like the perfect place for both hanging out there are cozy spaces behind the coffee bar and group work they have giant tables by the windows and its a great location close to kensiginton market they do charge extra for soy milk and it was the second most expensive latte ive had but i loved the space and would definitely go there again of the food items they had available i saw a couple vegan cookies from sweets from the earth which was nice
ybGHCaTR-wXTxF5rJz1TXg 3 tonight after nearly everything in kensington market was closed we saw a glowing light out of this new sadies juice bar location yes its open and right next to hot beanswe picked up two tofutti ice cream cones they had vanilla vanilla almond bark and chocolate and they were of course delicious lots of other options available like drinks floats sweets from the earth treats and soy delicious bars but i didnt  pay enough attention because i was too excited about stuffing my face full of my vanilla tofutti cone  the person there was kind enough to let us in after closing and i didnt want to overstay my welcomeim looking forward to visiting them again during the day
Df9X2MfmHiVR8KGCt0c53w 3 i walk by this place on the regular and through the power of the indie coffee passport i decided to actually go in and check it out it was crowded and very white modernish interior with an absolutely beautiful espresso machine their chairs arent comfy and the interior was brightly lit with natural light from all the windows so its definitely set up as more of a pick up and go place than a sit down for a while placethey charge extra for soy milk and did so when it pushed the price over the 4 dollar indie coffee passport limit the service was indifferent and the soy latte was okay but wasnt spectacular they dont have any vegan baked items though i think they had something gluten free while we were there  since i have too many options for really fabulous vegan friendly indie coffee shops in the neighbourhood i probably wont return to thor
zg8kiy719EmA2cHwxL3drg 3 im really digging this tea shop im not in the area as often as id like to be but when i am i usually stop in for a cup of tea its a tiny space but houses a nice variety of in house made tea blends i didnt think the selection was really that small but i think its a sign of quality kind of like a carefully selected wine list at a restaurant rather than i here is every single wine we could buy ever listservice has been lovely  the owner is consistently a nice helpful person and answers questions about tea and recommends things as neededtheyve got a nice variety of in house made tea blends but since im a creature of habit at least with tea i will probably just order an earl grey or a cacao tea probably forever i like that the cacao is from chocosol and that the tea tastes like some kind of chocolate magic while still being lightim going to have to look into some of their tea mixology classes
6PkCZqMq9pgpBBQEe00eDg 1 we ended up at ravis soups on queen street a few days ago after a failed attempt to check out el ruddy they were closedravis soups had a big group of people waiting for wraps so that was a nice sign they had a veggie wrap on the menu and a vegan soup option that said i wasnt excited about this place from the very beginning  service was weird and all over the place there wasnt a line waiting by the time we were at the counter but he was still frenetic and rushed but the food didnt come to us for quite a long time and as with most simple vegetable dishes i feel like i could have probably just made the wrap at homethe veggie wrap normally has brie in it and jut as a heads up one of the unlisted additions is mayo so you know if youre vegan ask for it without or just skip it and just opt for soup or go somewhere else the wrap came with a tiny salad that of course had just a little bit of mayo on it i guess a little bit of mayo is the same as no mayo not quitemy friend had the wrap and the porcini mushroom soup and loved it its based on an onion broth and has mushrooms barley and truffle oil in it so its actually vegan however soups all come with a cheese biscuitthis place like most of torontos restaurants is great for lactoovovegetarians but going there made me wish i had gone somewhere else on queen that was a bit more vegan friendly with more exciting options
urhz69ahF0pVy0IbI1PMeg 3 before we decided to wander through the ago yesterday morning we stopped into frank for brunch the server was awkward stiff and extremely formal in a way that seemed unnatural but overall very attentive and helpful so i wont hold her attempts at trying too hard against herfrank has a vegan dish on their brunch menu the roasted shiitake mushrooms with heirloom squash which was nice to see the server suggested a slightly more substantial dish the chef could make for us with braised lentils and eggplant also with heirloom squash and tat soi salad it was phenominalbeautiful presentation and absolutely delicious  but with phenominal food comes a phenominal price tag so that part was an unpleasant surprise
9lhodxDU2rSKsY3ni0CCFQ 3 id suggest any of the adults here check out one of legolands adult nights which happen on the last wednesday of every month where you can enjoy a kid free legoland i dont know what it looks like during the regular days but considering there were kids that didnt want to leave the park today there must be lots of them happy to skip that we booked adult night tickets in advance online so it was a bit cheaper than getting them at the door and while it still felt a bit expensive i did spend around 2 hours running around the park and having fun on rides there are two of them playing games and building cars and then racing them with lego and building minihouses with duplo so overall i had a good time i also liked the miniatures exhibit of torontos downtown and areaall of the staff was all friendly as wellthe thing is  legoland is small and there isnt that much to do we finished with everything quite quickly and found ourselves wondering what else is thereits in vaughn mills a mall at entrance 4 go on adult night
AnPjCb40a6zeTM_55kEctw 3 i snuck in here when it started to rain and wandered around looking at more barbapapa stuff than id seen even when i was a child adorable little baby products cookbooks aplenty and the most beautifully unnecessary albeit potentially useful kitchen accoutrements and accessoriesi loved this store couldnt help making a little list in my head of all the things i wantedone of the folks at the cash was pleasant and even held the door open for me when i was coming in the other one was pretty much off in her own world though this was fine with me since i just wanted to browse the store in peace and they didnt seem to care that i had been in there for a considerable amount of time
FEtMyYYTSQyOArTSrFSrHA 3 a friend and i some time to kill before seeing a movie at the scotiabank theater so we went to sushi time and grabbed a bite to eatwe ordered edamame as an appetizer and a few orders of cucumber and avocado maki well we got our maki first and it was good it was a bit on the big side and loosely wrapped but on the bright side the avocado and cucumber were fresh the edamame appeared after we had finished about half of the makithe service was friendly and we got our order quickly but at the end of the meal we waited about ten minutes for a bill every moment one of the staff would go by wed try and wave at them but theyd come rushing past us overall it was okay its a decent spot to go before a movie but i probably wouldnt seek it out on at any other time
C9Oy7FRDLfaEDmB7tGZGtQ 3 this gym is great im not sure what issues people have with it but this was my first experience with goodlife and overall it was extremely positivethe staff are friendly and helpful the trainers were friendly there are loads of treadmills elliptical machines bikes and equipment some old some new the best part about it is that it is nearly emptyi think the biggest selling point for me is that it has great change room facilities and amenities unlike the liberty village location that is now my regular location there isnt a mass veto on scented products and they have lotions different shampoos hair spray gel deodorant etc there is a hot tub sauna and steam room and more than enough showersi liked it now its just too far out of the way to visit
3pPmYHmobYxEBUJqw7CvgA 5 i went back here this weekend and had a pretty great time the staff are friendly the cafe was busy but the line moved quickly and our soy lattes were deliciousi still love this place and i still wish i was closer to them because id drink their coffee more often staff are so nice and seem to like working there and with each other that makes a huge difference to the whole coffee experience there are no vegan baked goods but it doesnt matter because their coffee is good enough to stand alone though you know i wouldnt be sad if there was a vegan cookie or two someday
XUfHQ65W_GmPm1oGW1UJkQ 3 before i finally moved to toronto i stayed at the fairmont royal york the main lobby was of course beautiful as most fairmont hotels are but the hotel room was tiny but the bed was comfortable and the room was spotless and really  i just wanted to have a good nights rest in somewhere a bit fancier than a typical hostel staythings that are great location location location products in the bathroom service was friendly

wl8BO_I-is-JaMwMW5c_gQ 3 i booked a table here for brunch and it did not disappoint it was a great experience and more relaxed i feel that the pricy dinner menu would of been with the same outdoor table overlooking the bellagio fountains and the paris hotel eggs benedict for me was fab and some other good options on the menu i told them we were celebrating a birthday and got a chocolate cake with a candle brought out which i was pleased to find was not included on our bill at the end
1d4kSfyD-VkRMiq7DbmmZQ 5 what a great find for a quick lunch the place was packed on a monday afternoon  but barely any wait even though there was a line the roti chicken was delicious along with the crispy yucca fries and a side of sweet plantains be sure to try all the pepper sauces the are all very flavorful and really complement the dishes nicely

L7rcSQGVx_R9G6BcdKbyCw 3 for now three stars because it was my first time and there was an hour wait time for a mediumlarge room then after we got the room 20 minutes later the machine just stopped  supposed cause is that there were too many people in the room  maybe it was just that night however i had a great time with friends and were coming back again this saturday  hopefully it will be a better experience

H-na7ABrMD-s3cjmIQGBdA 1 i agree from christopher bs review  buyer beware and never go to this place i have a great place that i will recommend read my review about portrait innovations however ive been here twice and it got worse every visit  the first visit was for my maternity photos because my friend recommended this place her photos are great however mine was not  the service was soso the sales person was that wanted to sell but she did take more than 30 shots  when i received my photos they were all dark and we blended in the background but the proofs were completely the opposite  ok so i let it go trying to give them benefit of the doubt  second time was more than a year later for my sons 1st birthday photos  this was really bad  the sales person is different from the last time and she was rudest person  she rushed the pictorial and wouldnt allow a family shot because per company policy can only take 1215 shots  bogus i bought the simplest package  she does not deserve a sale

0FLOX12IhKbxGOkRfk-0gQ 3 had called another motel chain from the highway for availability but the place looked grim so we dialed the nice looking red roof we passed the price was 5 bucks less plus we got upgraded the room was clean and well maintained the kingsized bed was great and the room was quiet  the included breakfast was barely adequate but at least there were hard boiled eggs and the dining area was light airy and well appointed  the simple addition of a microwave in the breakfast area would have earned another star for this red roof
WpIZdLr9DM85HaZwlyJv-g 1 this business has horrible service if you want anything done you better show up right when they open even if you just want a shower for your pooch for example i showed up yesterday 15 minutes before closing and receptionist said groomers all left for the day which makes sense i went today one hour before they close and receptionist tells me all the groomers left wtf really man fcl this place

16APj90kHure-seT99-2FA 1 the average tasting sushi and friendly service was totally undone by the nearly hour long wait to get our food after ordering the place isnt very big and was not busy when we place our order so the wait in my opinion was totally unjustified nice clean and fairly pricedbut way too slow
bkmJq3-uuvhTEpCnNyYU_w 1 venue is fine staff are business like but friendly enough parking is handy drinks arent too pricey the room is clean good visibility with a slanted floor or upgrade seating on the balcony upstairsbutthe sound mix is so bass heavy it buries the vocals and other instruments we went to hear singer zz ward could barely hear her and none of the keys guitar etc it was all bass guitar and kick drummaybe for a dj that is a great mix but a singers voice should be featured not unintelligibleit was so bad we left early wasted  wasted eveningsheesh
vI2Ia8lCtNd4hmHiuodbnw 1 bad sound mixexcessive volume ruined two visitsgreat looking new venue with fabulous possibilities reminiscent of the iconic fillmore in sftwo shows later the muddy sound mix with excessive volume drowning out vocals left a lot of room for improvementseems a live nation venue would do bettermaybe they need to hire someone to run the sound board who hasnt lost their hearing
GGJ5TKYwBX63AZ6Vx5MX3w 1 terrible customer serviceservice refund refusalthree trips to the store and two home visits by service staff it was determined the internet extender network could not perform as advertisedwhile frys was willing to refund the purchase price of the materials the service manager refused to refund the 100 serviceinstallation chargeeven though their staff could not successfully install the equipmentconcluding there was a design flaw preventing successful installationeven after a store visit the manager continued to refuse to refund the service charge for their unsuccessful workis it any wonder this chain is experiencing difficulties this customer is not returning
SS43QfqyXztpQfogDvW5og 3 cedars cafe is fantasticive been here a few times for lunch and the service is great and the food delicious the falafel sandwich is perhaps my favorite its unfortunate that they charge for extra sauce hot sauce especially otherwise a nofrills place to enjoy my lunch break away from the office
c0yPNW622TY-O7Mmu2s9qw 1 mike showed up on time  he gave me a price over the phone  but said we could negotiate up or down depending on what i had  i should have rented a truck from home depot since it was only a pickup load size and weight the cost would have been less than 12 the 200 he charged me  i tried negotiating with him but no luck  so i gave up wouldnt use again ron
PBnRZZOW7YH4aho_EkqvWg 1 the games are cool but if you want customer service this is not the place they really need to understand of they continue i could careless attitude there going to lose there loyal customers
4pUZusZRy9b5zgaO2KNo9Q 5 the more of total wine  more is why we went in  while traveling we are always looking for unique and hard to find bourbons  ken was very knowledgable about their products and bourbon in general  we really appreciated all the time he took with us to find just the right gift to bring back home
NVNKOfNgDbcRmImWcim5tA 1 i am not sure about others this is my experience on a saturday morning on may 21st there were two ladies as a customer service rep the rudest i ever met gosh i wonder what they think about themself its too hard for them to answer a question and ask you back rude questionscustomer service at the pooresti hope somebody tell them they really suck in their job i wonder what make them so upset early in the morning people shouldnt do their job if they dont like it please leave the customers alone

40zwgvZe5LKT9zV1USU4AA 1 after reading a description of this restaurant in the newspaper i was very excited to take my mother daughters and sister for brunch we were all very disappointed in both the food and the service it took an hour to get our food  my sister and i both ordered a medium rare cheeseburger that came out well done and dry the burgers had no sauce and were mediocre my mother ordered pancakes and they were rather dense and tasteless  we agreed that none of us will be returning to this restaurant
HF8u90Li0j7U08u2ckctoQ 3 great little brew house in boulder nv great food interesting combos for burgers and salads micro beer sampler was great six moderate sized samples of diverse beers definitely a fun place to visit before or after visiting hoover dam

thgVx8OypGAsf8yRJx62OA 3 i tried the beef brisket pulled pork and butter chicken pies my favourite was the pulled pork but they were all good each pie is hearty and the pastry was flakey there was plenty of filling so one pie would be more than enough for me the place is on a side road tucked in the lower level there are 23 stool seats inside but a couple larger tables outside frozen pies can also be bought and reheated later the togo box includes instructions on how to reheat the pies
OF45ie3PYEe39zBA_moaLw 3 got the lap cheung chinese sausage and seaweed egg waffle and matcha ice cream the soft serve ice cream was very creamy and while it was good i didnt think it needed to be incorporated with the wafflethe lap cheung waffle was an interesting mix of sweet and savoury there was no line up when we went at night and the waffle was made well not underdone or overdonewasnt going to come because of all the hype and most likely wont be back unless i happen to be in the area
uGaXxtYMvHS4hVqkSmpB_w 3 i liked my thin noodles and beef short ribs the broth wasnt oily which was good the tofu snack was ok but not a mustget i thought the shaved noodle was slightly too al dente for me but overall it was finetheres a presotea inside but i didnt get anything this timeordering from and ipad was easy and convenient for those who dont speak mandarin the menu is available in english and chinese
26pIpt1mlsrseKkMMqS43A 3 1 margherita pizza 10nice thin crust with a good amount of cheese made in a stone oven 2 broccolini and sausage pasta 13linguini was al dente generous amount of sausage and broccolini good portion the restaurant is a nice space the decor was well done the prices are a bit high for lunch but for dinner this would be a good option
At1d9VRv995PILES3Iathg 3 1 grabong 10 deep fried battered squash fritters with a garlic tamarind dip i really like this as an appetizer the tangy dip complements the sweet squash well2 gaeng kiaw wan in a coconut 15 green curry with bamboo shoots kaffir lime leaves basil leaves green peppers and coconut milk served in a coconut with rice choice of chicken beef pork shrimp fish tofu or veggies lots of meat in the curry good for sharing3 khao pla tawt 14 crispy basa fillet with oyster sauce crispy shallots served with 2 sauces fresh chilli sauce and tangy tamarind sauce i loved this because the fish was crispy the entire time and it wasnt greasy4 khao soi with beef 14 fresh egg noodles in a golden curry topped with crispy noodles coriander and green onions choice of braised beef chicken breast or chicken drumsticks consistently good dish from chef nuit the golden curry is flavourful and rich but not heavy braised beef was tender 5 papaya salad  salted crab 10 shredded green papaya tomato long green beans garlic red chilli tamarind juice fish sauce coconut sugar and freshly squeezed lime the salted crab tasted like sashimi and though the claws were small they were very salted which balanced out the rest of the salad 6 i moo ping 10 northern thai street grilled pork on a skewer 3 skewers
Sb2acgyby6sbFd3gBqA8ZA 3 the squared pies and the box it comes in makes it easy to eat on the go i tried the jalapeo chicken and chicken pot pies in the big size they were filling but the small ones wouldve been a great snack there are about 1520 seats inside and the decor is math pi and science themed each table also had a photo of famous mathematicians
S0cZdDxmwK8wLoR-sbCuiQ 5 we went on a sunday around 1pm and had to wait for about 10min for a table of 2 we ordered the eggs benny on a donut and the stuffed french toast i loved the ricotta stuffed french toast because the ricotta made it lighter than cream cheese the donut in the eggs benny was a nice change to the usual english muffin the sweetness of the donut balanced the peameal i would definitely go back for brunch and get some donuts to go
QFGLrzN3GKdGBMGfB4yK7w 3 toronto roll looks like a mess but loaded  top layer cucumber avocado  middle layer assorted pieces of sashimi  bottom layer tempura roll overallgood sushi big portions price is decent for the quality and quantity
xIhsEyb8LTuDXxrEaYBkGQ 1 we were hungry and didnt want to wait for a table at sushi house a few doors down grilled duck breast 8 for 5 thin slices it was overdone so it was dry and a bit tough katsu don 10 the rice was too burnt on arrival and it tasted a bit too salty there was a lot of rice and not a lot of chicken raku roll 13 their signature roll was small inside was white fish crab meat and cucumber the spicy sauce was good we could taste the torched flavour aburi
o_58w-4pzCTImpnv7D9TRg 5 the prices are good the food is authentic and the portions are bigthe laksa is flavourful and quite spicy even when we ordered as mild as possible i liked the durian shake because i could taste the durian this is definitely not for everyoneonly a few seats available so its best to get it to go call and order ahead because there is usually a wait especially around lunch time
xFY4qMWVg2iB3ukkQBVigg 3 went on a weeknight and didnt have to wait for 2 seats squid inkportobello interesting flavours and filling despite the size if the dish offal sausagetastes similar to chinese sausage this almost seemed like a breakfast dish because it had an egg on top cannoli and waffle so good the citrus flavour of the cannoli was light and refreshing the waffle wasnt too sweet so i definitely couldve had more than 1
JMze73HpaNQfCqIe4Gqszg 3 1 big eye tuna sliders 1096 ahi bigeye tuna wasabi napa slaw sweet soy pickled ginger i ordered this appetizer for lunch and it was enough for me good balance of slaw and fish the buns were soft and toasted
mDmBLneb8D-vFXHruNKBtA 3 ive only been when it was about to close but the pancake still tastes good 1 brown sugarpeanut pancake great warm snack any time of the day not too sweet and would go nicely with tea or coffee
DAaTHXfFIiSXEmtIGAjn2w 3 the venue looks nice the food was decent for a wedding of over 250 people the lounge area was very cold even when the room was full the staff was ok not too attentive but given the size of the wedding its understandable that they are constantly occupied they took away our champagne glasses after one toast so we didnt have them to toast for the rest of the night not a huge deal but wasnt sure why they did that
lQix2S5OiE9ZqJsqvhF_kg 1 i ordered a vermicelli bowl with 2 toppings fried meat ball and spring roll for 699 the spring roll was pretty small and it was mostly taro in it there werent a lot of noodles so the portions were on the smaller side the tom yum noodle soup was spicy but the portion was ok we wanted to order a sago dessert and were told that the kitchen was too busy to make it the restaurant was less than half full and it was 830pm so we didnt think our request was too much we understood that there was only 1 server but we would have been ok with waiting a bit for dessert instead of being denied completely we will not be back
mldnei2GGYCPYDN53BEWgg 3 i liked their version of a charcuterie board because it had katsu fried pork cutlet and shrimp tempura i tried the soju flight and it was interesting the flavours were strawberry cucumbers and ginseng the sweet potato fries and chicken wings were one of my favourites
MB4rRTjU-urXQ5ri9JRVwA 3 1 pad thai not ketchupbased or too sweet mine was salty but it wouldve been good if it was less salty not spicy comes with shrimp and chicken 2 vermicelli with spring roll shrimp on sugar cane spring rolls were small and overfried shrimp on sugar cane was bigger than other places
AIjYq6Svq76Sc0eJ3Md-6g 3 the food was similar to a homecooked version ive had so i liked it the restaurants decor is modern and definitely stands out from the rest of the ones in the plaza to order you pay at the counter and find a table until your food is ready theres a bit of confusion when the bell is rung because no one knows whose meal it is until you go up to checkoverall not a bad lunch spot but probably wont be on our regular rotation
STTywk69Lkvh5DHt0A2Ebg 1 1 burger  305big burger bun patty is premade from a manufacturer condiments and toppings are basic sautedraw onions mustard relish cheese extra  overallfor a late night burger it does the trick no tables just a counter and a bench many people eat in the parking lot or their car
IPkg-efP6AGc9HStXkty9A 1 usually go for the half price wings deal but that is no longer offered ordered the ribwing platter to split between 2 people 1 wingrib platter  big wings with good amount of meat ribs were tender and not dry fries a lot also comes with vegetables good deal for 17 to share
EOqZWpLZKNsO5q0aDzOQcQ 3 1 bnive been looking for a pho place that serves bn with this exact combination spring roll grille meat ball and shrimp on sugar cane finally found it here 2 pho broth was clear and light but still flavourful good amount of meat 3 jackfruit milkshake contains real jackfruit not too blended so you could still feel the fruit restaurant was still 34 full on a sunday night with a thunderstorm on the way service was fine milkshake came at the me of our meal but maybe they were too busy or forgot would return here
LkrsZJAqxUL-bGTT16yErg 3 opening special 799 reg 999 for many rolls ordered the lady in red and sunrise rolls the ingredients inside these 2 rolls were the same but we preferred the crab on the lady in red our server was friendly and attentive the store is very small with only 2 tables of 4 seats free delivery available over 20 and within the delivery area the 799 deal is great and hopefully they can keep it
VutlvXHXVH414zT7clhlBQ 3 bangcakes  12 only at the liberty village location fluffy pancakes  caramelized banana  coconut  peanut brittle  pineapplei dont love pancakes but i enjoyed these the caramel sauce was a bit heavy by the end but we did dip into it generouslycorned beef  sweet potato hash  poached eggs  hollandaise  15im glad we shared this one it was pretty good but it wouldve been too rich and heavy for me to consume by myselfservice our server was good she came by at the right times not too often but not rarely seen eitherreservationsi made a reservation through opentable but it didnt count towards any points too bad because it was the only reason i used opentablemenupricesthe price was about expected for the liberty village area if i go back for brunch id want to try the french toast duck confit or the pork belly fried rice
ZIWZtVZyscL9Re7W7mARew 3 the nacho chips guacamole and cheese dip were our favourite pulled pork fish and bulgogi tacos were all just ok the space is nice and fits with the king west atmosphere seating is community style shared tables you place your order and grab a seat when it becomes available
GuOKAJLYsFEK5VWZcIYiiw 3 1 ice cream sandwich  half portion gingerr cookie with chunks of candied ginger  cinnamon toast ice cream i really like the homemade ice cream it was creamy and flavourful cinnamon was not overpowering and did taste like cinnamon toast crunch  cookie wasnt too sweet or gingeryoveralli would go back there was a lineup after dinner on a weeknight but worth the wait
76CMnMZi3-1lMDBX4Cpbew 3 good venue for an outdoor wedding ceremony and tented reception lots of nice spots for photos outside catering is allowed the staff was good to us the guests
B_Skd9-ha2GHrxkyeWKm1g 3 the mclean house was beautiful with many spots for wedding photos the outdoor ceremony location was shaded by the trees so its perfect for a late afternoon ceremony there are many nice rooms for photos inside the house the reception room was small so its great for an intimate wedding the lighting is mixed due to big windows on one end of the room the staff was accommodating and took care of us wedding photographers the food was made well chicken was not dry and vegetables were fresh
fKPRKvImyawPSPw_5ie12A 3 the space is very small but its nice for groups of 24 we had 3 in our group the team is friendly and helpful when answering questions about the menu i dont have a favourite dish but i liked parts of the ones we ordered 1 bbq shrimp nachos guacamole tamatillo chilli jazz the nachos were really crispy and overall i liked this as an appetizer2 patty melt burger grilled cheese fried onions  french fries chili mayo i love thinshoestring fries because it reminds me of mcdonalds fries  the patty was juicy and thick  i liked the grilled cheese especially the bread the chilli mayo had a hint of pear which was pretty interesting3 fried chicken sour pickle brine warm mushrooms and potato salad soft egg the fried chicken skin was similar to kentucky fried chicken and the meat was very tender and juicy the vegetables were okim just glad there were some greens if you dont like mustard you may want to avoid the veggies notice all the mustard seeds
xH5iykOsioxMq2FNKA4aNw 3 ordered the spicy sausage pizza the sausage wasnt spicy at all and it was quite salty the dough was good though also ordered the lemon sparkling drink which was refreshingservice was good friendly and attentive staff
xxOOWVyQ40vkN8KGPAFYlg 3 i like the appetizer rolls with lettuce and pork its definitely meant for sharing as the 2 rolls are cut into 8 pieces but can also be eaten as a meal i also like to order the bun  vermicelli with spring rolls and vietnamese sausage for the quality and the price i think its good value
rwtMyCczj7q5YmyktQJQzw 3 soft chorizo taco the chorizo didnt taste like chorizo to me but the taco was good soft fish taco i liked this one better than the chorizo even though i chose the chorizo overall i liked the soft taco shell because it didnt taste as store bought as many taco places there arent many seats 67 picnic tables but worth a try anyway tacos were 330 so it made for a good snack for us
CDLla4GM3KvayJbbI1kxeg 3 the french toast was thick only finished 1 of he 2 slices and the maple syrup has citrus flavours in it which may not be everyones cup of tea but i liked it because it cut the sweetness the eggs benedict were good but the roasted potatoes stood out to me more than the eggs benny  we got there at around 10 and had to wait about 510 minutes shortly after that the line grew and it got very busy before brunch time
no13cefqzwA-H3f-zu84RQ 3 i tried the berliner donut which is a sugar donut with a vanilla bean custard inside it was very good and not too sweet despite the sugar coating on the outside the custard was rich and there were visible vanilla bean seeds so the flavour was good

XZLqTkMNFSMqBS0BDhnkug 3 we ordered 3 chicken shawarmas a beef shawarma and a beef samosa the beef samosa was very big and packed with meat it was a bit spicy but not so strong that it would burn your mouththe shawarma wasnt that big compared to other places but i liked that it was warmed on a panini press first they were 2 for 850 so for the price it was good
OzZQaIQsYXCQfZis0a68cg 1 the asian fusion aspect of the menu was not great1 crabavocado salad not bad but nothing special expensive for half an avocado and crab2 lambduck prosciutto dumplings  loaded with meat crispy skin i liked this one3 taro fries the crispy ones were good but the thicker fries were chewy4 ribs expensive for 2 pieces of ribs very saucy and tender but wouldnt recommend this5 steamed black cod fish came in 2 pieces of aluminum foil the small piece of fish was sitting in a pool of soup the truffle oil was unnecessary and overpowering wouldnt recommend this overallwe wont be returning due to the mediocre food and service
UTtf0ToTHF25hV8lRBI6CA 3 1 pad thai vegetable  tofu  895noodles had good texture not mushy a lot of vegetables and a variety the base was not spicy nor ketchupy they put a lot of peanuts on top which i like 2 thai iced tea  3 cheaper than most places but it is smaller either the tea was brewed stronger or there was less evaporated milk because the tea was darker than usual and not as sweet it was different than other places but still good though small restaurant 20 or so seats it was mostly empty on a sunday night so we didnt have to wait and the service was good
1Py_X1Hf92sIoI5VEdlp8w 1 didnt know they had a brunch menu and happened to go at brunch time1 french toastthe french toast was filling and rich the sourdough was good and not soggy 2 wingssmall wings so they gave about 15 wings not bad but wish they were bigger
Zbj0HgdN3AT4l-mbH-EfjA 3 burger week1 blazing pineapple burger 5 decent burger good size patty and bun only special addition was a grilled slice of pineapple which did add a nice touch to it the sauce was spicy and can definitely feel the kick after every bite overallnot bad for a quick bite but wouldnt go out of the way to get it
0a0ajI-WrpB5igOpEvhb-w 3 all you can eat and lunch special menus available prices on the website are for the steeles location the don mills location seemed a dollar or 2 more chicken teriyaki don not bentoh comes with miso soup and salad bentoh comes with gyoza too  chicken was a bit burnt and dry there was enough teriyaki sauce to cover the chicken and rice service was good very friendly staff that spoke english well decor is much more modern than the restaurant that was there before tako sushi may return for ayce menu

R4Zfk-P6WWHtdGUs62cJhQ 3 when i was looking for the menu online most of the information out there was out of date the prices have gone up 23spicy pork neck tacos 10 for 2 tacosi liked the amount of meat and cabbage in the tacosspicy pork buns 9  1 burger cut into quartersi liked that the buns were soft we tasted the same spicy sauce in the tacos as the tacos it was good but didnt jump out at mesoo yook  48hour braised beef 12id skip this onegalbi ssm set  short rib 20i liked the galbi flavourful and not too much fat i usually leave the fat behindserviceour server couldve been more friendlypleasant she wasnt rude but didnt appear very welcoming either maybe thats the casual vibe theyre going forreservationsthey do take reservations but when we arrived it didnt seem like we needed one on a tuesday night around 745pm i used opentable anyway to get points
BuQYpKfuLwQvAFBOONXOaQ 1 the food is not great but the price is ok we dont come for the service but we dont have to wait for a seat during the sunday lunch hour so its bearable if we have a group larger than 8 we get the party special otherwise the other lunch specials are reasonably priced about 810
Haw0-6QBUehLjsP9pm9SqQ 3 on a wednesday night the restaurant was about half full so no wait needed for a table the staff was great got a free delicious garlic bread with a yelp check in the small personal pizza is about 910 inches really like the simple minimalist decor
lbtnLC9fxYgs0Yv7czHgBg 3 i usually order the combo special of the day 599799 the meal is big enough for me to split into 2 it also comes with a small side of kimchi which you take yourself from the fridge combos come with miso soup salad and jap chae glass noodles the fishpork cutlets are huge and a lot of rice accompanies it this is one of my goto spots for lunch in st clair centre its located in the food court lower level tucked away behind a chinese fast food place
eI14GD-Fimc44xwXDT92fw 3 food lunch specials ranged from 79thai iced tea was 350 but we found it a bit watered down not as much condensed milk or tea flavour as we wouldve likedpad thai sweet and sauce and not ketchup basedkhao soi the noodles didnt seem like egg noodles but the overall flavour was good there was some spice to it which we liked the beef was ok not too dry like most places service we experienced good service and had no complaints our server patiently explained the items we werent familiar with parkingwe went on a sunday for lunch and there was ample parking in the small plazas lot overall we would go back to try some other dishes
pSA46ixR4LqnPPVKdJFuVg 1 i thought the the name of the place was clever the words noodle and face sound the same in cantonese and repeating a noun in cantonese is somhow parents would talk to their children 1 jiajiang mien not a lot of jiajiang sauce2 spicy noodles noticeable amount of heat definitely big enough to share between 2 people with an average appetite overallwould rather head to chinatown for noodles not a lot of seats looked like under 50
cEQ9swcZ_L0GMCKI0UtItQ 1 pad thai beef the beef used was tough and chewy the pad thai was too saucy lunch special for pad thai is 659
_6QhFCaMDuGMrfRrbX6HUA 3 i come here regularly and usually order the pad thai or bun vermicelli with shrimp on sugar cane grilled pork and vietnamese sausage the pad thai is large enough for me to split into 2 meals but if youre a big eater you could finish it in one sitting its on the sweeter side and not the dry kind there is a generous portion of meatthe bun with shrimp on sugar cane grilled pork and sausage is good a good variety and filling the pho is good not too salty and the broth is clear not muddy the owners are friendly and accommodating as we usually come with a large group
cMcOtNwViSmS4k0pAuOA1A 3 i was going to try out this place after looking at yelp and then was recommended by a friend asuke was my stylist and was great at recommending a hairstyle that suit me i told him i was donating my hair and he was very careful in measuring the length my wash was relaxing and not rushed asuke was detailed and spent a good amount of time on my hair i was happy with the cut and the advice asuke gave me on styling and taking care of my ends i have never paid 50 for a haircut plus 12 wash before but since i hadnt cut my hair in 12 years it was worth getting a quality cut
syfc0cAEFJ4hR4ZfLe97mw 3 i like aburi torched style sushi so i was excited for miku came here at lunch on a weekday during the holidays and it wasnt very busy we didnt make a reservation so we were seated near the chefs which is also away from the windows facing queens quay could also be because we werent dressed in suits the aburi was well done not too torched the seafood platter was good for sharing between 23 people the staff was great but our food came out slowly
ehJkFZGsWO_Wgu6JmScLzQ 3 there are some good deals from time to time good selection in a small space always clearance bins outside some brands sold include tretorn hunters frye birkenstock converse toms uggs etc
DzWQ9c6CiaE_nHuvzTXfZA 1 ordered from the summerlicious menu unfortunately it didnt live up to the 35 price there was nothing wrong with the food but the flavours didnt complement each other and the dishes werent very special we left disappointed service was fine and the staff was quick to clear our plates and utensils and replace them with a new set most likely wont return
bLFibCuVWzDEP7NJCj1Uig 1 nice decor but would rather pay less for the same dish at another location1 vermicelli with spring roll and grilled pork  crispy spring roll pork was not dry noodles were not clumpy overallas nice as the decor is the prices were higher than other similar pho restaurants and the menu was smaller service was good
VIYgJom4_fARhYHBRZxUVA 3 i like the patio on a nice day there can be quite the wait i usually order the fish tacos or the seared tuna salad the fish tacos are nicely battered and the dipping sauce provides a nice kick the salad is filling for me and its light and refreshing for the summer
mXfeeJcSZ_1I8L8Smk3TAA 3 oysters were fine the hot sauces that went with them werent very hot at all except for the hottest one my smoked salmon didnt taste different than store bought ones my homemade ice tea was unique not too sweet and wasnt l overpowered by lemon either our server was very nice and accommodating she made some good suggestions to us im not sure i would return i may go back to dianas seafood instead
zPZrjrcrtvN5xtGFHz8V5Q 3 expensive mexican food ingredients and technique were good but execution could be improved ceviche verdenice big chunks of fishpollo en pippian rojothe chicken was bland and the red sesame sauceancho chile didnt add much flavour just spice couldve used more salt i usually dont need to add more salt to anything
0roBFbQ_gZJ4QHRwNTfovw 3 i only come here because it is cheap and there isnt usually a wait or a very short wait there is a tea surcharge but still ends up being cheaper for the same amount of food as other places the quality is fineespecially for the price there are about 3 large tables for groups of 8 or more mostly tables for 46 some tables of 2 along the wall lots of parking the plaza is mostly empty
M0APvULM1g1rv5VJe9L6vg 1 1 loukoumades fried dough balls with honey fully soaked in the honey syrup and sprinkled with cinnamon good but probably even better when warm 2 galaktoboureko greek custard pie loaded with custard the custard was not too sweet and wasnt like a smooth pudding consistency it was thicker and not runny
glvmn8Dz4h6MjYNz3YCwSg 1 we had a reservation on a friday night at 630 and the place was practically empty we asked for a room which had space for our legs below service was fine the food was fine nothing above and beyond what you would expect the sashimi pieces were a good size the sushi rolls didnt have too much rice my tunaavocado tartare appetizer was bland so it tasted like a tuna roll without the rice i probably wouldnt come back
NVrctfa0yT9XRO1JPwrkaw 3 duck salad  15my favourite dish out of the 6 we ordered the portion was bigger than i expected a good mix of textures and flavours warning peanutsrare beef  16there were 4 slices of soft rare beef i thought it was okprobably wouldnt order it againtartare 2 ways  101 spicy tuna with avocado on a crispy rice cake2 salmon with shallots on a crispy rice cakei enjoyed the tartare and the deep fried rice added a nice crunchbraised spiced short ribs  22this was my least favourite dish but it was probably because i was expecting thinly sliced short ribs like galbi short ribs shanghainese steamed pork belly with sauteed brandy apples  19the pork belly was ok  i dont like cooked apples so that didnt appeal to me our meal came with complimentary dessert i believe every diner gets it which was a nice surprise servicewe went shortly after it opened so we werent surprised when there were a few dishes that were delivered to us by mistake but the staff was very friendly kai came out to chat with us and apologized that we couldnt take a photo with susur because it was during the dinner rush menupricesoverall i liked our meal its out of my price range so i probably wouldnt go back unless it was a special occasion
V7Biz07tJScTgan6l4Q1pg 1 1 crepe  nothing special about the crepe the basic topping was jam costs ectra for toppings like fruit nutella etc2 macarons flavours sound unique but some were strange lavender was my favourite 3 creme brule  the custard was ok the brule couldve been done better it didnt taste like it was made to order
bbs_1e7fj6axj48c3YRBJg 3 a small brunch spotordered the smoked trout plate and eggs federal the trout plate had a lot of trout and overall the meal was filling the poached eggs in the eggs federal were overdone but the rest of the dish was good also got a house made root beer which was similar to a typicalcommon root beer but tastes more earthywe came at around 10am on a tuesday during the holidays and we didnt have to wait for a table
0vITqbidNLldWrDSah6Uqg 3 if i go back to lee i would only order the slaw again the decor and ambiance in the main dining area are  asianinspired as expected but also appears somewhat dated 1 singaporeanstyle slawwe ordered chef susurs famous signature dish the singaporeanstyle slaw 20 and added tuna sashimi 10 this slaw was very good there are so many ingredients but they work well together and it was refreshing and light the tuna sashimi was smoked on the outside and it didnt really add any flavour so i would probably skip that the tuna does add a contrasting texture to the crunchy slaw i arrived hungry and felt full after eating half of this dishnote there are peanuts 2 peking  char sui duck 29 beijing duck garnish steamed pancake foie gras ptthis is not the same as what you would expect from a traditional chinese restaurant style peking duck i didnt enjoy this very much 3 warm molten chocolate cake 12 caramelized jackfruit  banana vanilla bean ice creamnothing unique about this dessert but it was delicious anyway
jYrqbQ0bJxZLLyFS8shuAg 3 for the price the lunch specials are well worth it lunch specials are on until 3pm we ordered some specials like mapo tofu general tsao chicken and cornfish on rice all were priced between 56 the portions were good my mapo tofu was big enough to split into 2 meals the staff was friendly but did get one of our orders wrong to be fair we did have a group of 12 the restaurant is small but has 2 large round tables and a few smaller tables the plaza doesnt have too much parking but the plaza isnt usually packed so we didnt have troubles finding a spot but we did go on a sunday well come back because of the price and location
m2EfmElhpy_4VwC0Ywb1iQ 3 the nduja sausage pizza was very good the thin crust was not too crispy and not too soft another favourite was the anchovie pizza but i wish there were more anchovies the calamari appetizer was great for sharing for 23 people
R9mg7G1a4BlS3icwOCzUvQ 3 customizable level of spiciness and niceness even a mild level of spice may be too much for someone who cant take much heatask for additional noodles at no charge can only pay by debit with minimum 20 purchase the lamb noodle bowl was ok the lamb smell wasnt that strong
CpoSl-eRJ3Miv0D9CITXsA 3 a new grab n go sushi shop regular price 399 for small boxes 599 for large grand opening special 40 off just opened this week so not too much variety yet but regular prices are better than other sushi joints quality is good so far from what i can tell the ratio of rice to fish is fair its too early to make any concluding thoughts but will be back to get a quick bite
useIM496OuyjFzyLV9mAzQ 3 i thought the pho here was ok i came on a recommendation but didnt find the broth a standout i did notice that it was empty at dinner time on a weeknight but filled up when we finished around 9pm

HaAtesB8T7L2ugTm_WDnuA 3 ive been twice and was glad that the food was good both times the prices are decent for the entertainment district and the quality of the food the zucchini fritti was good but a bit too oily arancini came in 3s and it was nice for sharing not a must try thoughthe prosciutto pizza was good the crust was very thin so if you like thin crust you may enjoy thisoverall pleasantly surprised and would prefer to come here over some of the other nice restaurants in the area
8u3QdC0s0dUb5hrspfiRMg 3 1 maki setthe maki sets contain large rolls but the rolls are similar so it almost feels like you ordered one type of roll 2 sashimi boat each piece was thick and evenly sliced servicegreat staff decorthere are individual rooms with curtains or tables in the main dining area they take reservations but weve never had to wait the location is not the best but there is lots of parking
oRAh8WcaN_08TV_sZ9Bd4A 1 service was rushed and the staff didnt clear the plates often so the table was full of piles of plates this was towards the end of the night with an hour left of service last call was at 10 and the staff was turning down the restaurant even though closing is at 11 the food was ok some special rolls were interesting but the menu was about the same in quality and selection as other ayce places overall not a great experience and would not return
7q_wKt_1jf_46_8FklgzCw 3 went on a tuesday night at around 730pm it was pretty full only a couple tables available one was for a large group one 2person table there are a few counter seats for single diners 1 ma po tofu  695very spicy no ground beef like most places lots of chilli oil good but wish it had meat in it 2 pork intestine hand pulled noodle a small bowl had quite a lot of noodles not mushy noodles firm texture pork intestine was a nice balance broth was flavorful but not too salty

yff_3vVG6FxquxmH4V04Hg 3 decent indian food not incredible but not bad eitheri usually go for the lunch buffet 895person since shelling out 50 for a decent dinner for two doesnt give me the food for value i can get elsewhere in town  as someone else mentioned they have a latenight 12 off deal but unless you want to eat dinner around midnight it doesnt make too much sensenothing stands out in my mind as a must have or to die for but on the flip side nothing is a must miss either
j6PJKcfyZdCtSha8mhVFpA 1 this place has been around for decades and coraopolis is full of italians from the homeland however i dont know any of them that eat here regularlyafter the place was featured in diners dives  drive ins i figured what the heck ill give it a try i wont make that same mistake again the sauce was oily as was shown in the episode and bland and noodles were tasteless home made maybe but not the way i do it it wasnt the worst italian ive ever had buy definitely not up to pittsburgh italian standardshow anyone could rate this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me
5KM9SvL6Tii_C2QvWQ64hQ 3 love this place best new barrestaurant in the area limited but excellent on tap beer list food is solid good vibe if you havent been definitely give it a try similar to good fellas on mt nebo rd acros the river
F3vb0OGmKwWW8ohaZarSbg 3 another one of my favorites in the burgh kaya has been around for quite a while and it used to be a refueling stop for me on christmas eve before diving in with the shopping masses on penn avenuetheir specialty tropas tropical tapas were here way before ibiza and all of the other tapas bars in town caught on with the idea of serving little dishes although the tropas menu has been substantially reduced from kayas glory days there are still some tasty treats on the menu the tuna tataki or whatever its called  sashimi tuna seaweed sesame seed all chopped up and marinated in a soybased sauce served cold and with some crackers is great i also like the conch fritters and the tofu cracklins  deep fried tofu served with a sweet chipotle sauce a little too sweet and not spicy enough for me  nowhere near the heat of mapo doufu  but it is good neverthelessi have never tried any of their main dishesso i cant comment on them its usually 34 tropas between me and the mrs
kpYADTRQ8LcvvagZdwk7cQ 3 i rarely give out 5 stars it has to be incredible food and drinks or something so new and delicious that nothing else compares with that being said the naked grape was very good time the place is intimate maybe 10 tables total and also has a decent wine list for the burghthe food was fresh and good although portions were a tad on the small side so we ended up sharing plates like a tapas bar and kept ordering until we were full i would definitely go back for more as others have mentioned you can sit and eat at the bar which is not a typical bar used to serve customers drinks before they are seated  it is definitely meant for dining and you can even reserve seats at the barthe owners who were inspired to open the place after a few trips to italy were working that night and service was pleasant and attentive it is a hidden gem and not your typical restaurant in the burgh
8Ap1Bg9fJwwlRRSdUhuKdg 5 best burger in the op hands down fire alarm burger mmmmits in the old waynes lounge  mutzigs building for yinz old timers  hand made chips fries and burgers  always fresh never frozen
nyahh6-LJ1fiskNTwxcFsQ 3 excellent dryaged beef you won find a better one in town and you will pay dearly for itsimilar in atmosphere and menu to mortons the capital grille is located on the ground floor of the former lazarus building at the corner of wood  fifthexpect dark paneled wood a massively overpriced 300 and up wine list and oil paintings of pittsburghs forefathers including mr rogers  the little things like impeccable service by the bartenders and umbrellas to your car on rainy nights by the valet staff are refereshing regarding the food  appetizers were just ok id give a big thumbs up to the any of the dry aged steaks simple and delicious and the house speciality and a thumbs down to the filet oscar filet mignon topped with lump crabmeat and a bearnaise sauce  also please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries if you like truffles  these are to die for desserts are nothing special  id give a pass on the key lime pie when i go back its straight to the dry aged steak and truffle fries for me
wRooMtZCPaTnaPIoLa2TCg 3 one of my favorite places for breakfast in the area  no frills mancini toast reasonable prices like 4 to 7 per personif you are really hungry try the 3egg scramble 3 scrambled eggs mixed with grilled onions peppers sliced italian sausage and melted cheddar cheese  with mancini toast and butter if you finish all of it you probably wont need to eat again until dinnerthe 2  3 egg combos are also good sandwiches for lunch are not bad but breakfast is definitely a better call
zJd6NFUk7ARsWApBUzXqVQ 1 unless youve been here before let me warn you about the unspoken house rules 1 order first do not try and sit down2 wait for your food while standing3 find a seat if one is availableunder no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order and if the place is full dont try and sit down without food in your hands unless you want to be made an example ofmy wife and i who frequent restaurants several times a week have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place  we had never been here before and when we walked in my wife sat down at a table and i went up to place our orderlittle did i know the house rules see above and after the people in front of me ordered the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table of newbies and said to the person who just placed the order you can either sit there or there with the tact of say general patton she never asked us to get up or explained the unwritten rules to us  an excuse me but you need to order first before you sit down would have sufficedso my wife got up and we walked out of this place the food could very well be good  but with waitstaff like this woman  there are plentty of other places around town with notso crummy service that id prefer to spend my money
v5TbiilMa8fZM9YMo2YzUw 3 if you love well done burgers then this is the place for you also if you love homemade potato chips instead of fries me not so muchdont get me wrong the food is not bad the five alarm burger is nicely spiced but forgot asking for med rare or medium burgers youre getting well done like it or not
wJCwNuKcvHfzLqSzL66xOg 3 let me preface this by saying i love sushi nobu matsuhisa and kazunori nozawa are two guys i used to visit frequently in la for the good stuff  i mean the really really good stuff andys sushi bar aint in the same galaxyhowever i must say andy is the man how can you go wrong with a takeout only sushi restaurant inside the largest fresh fish market in town wholeys especially in a town like pittsburgh which doesnt come to mind when you think fresh sushiive had my fair share of nasty fish around town even in some nice places that looked like the fish should have tasted better and fresher than it was then i found andy no frills no bar but hey the fish is as fresh as youre gonna get in these parts of the usapeople seem to lineup for his endless list of rolls  and there are plenty i never got why someone would order a fried chicken roll personally i prefer the lunch special which includes 8 pieces of nigiri sushi whatever is fresh that dayusually yellowtail tuna salmon and eel as well as eight pieces of some roll andy throws together in front of you  like a spicy california roll or salmon and cucumber roll you get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day total is around 1400 for this particular orderand one other word of caution especially around holidays and on fridays wholeys can be jammed with people  i mean packed  so if you dont like crowds or if you dont like standing in line to order your food and watch andy make it fresh  then call ahead and place your order for pickup there is also a decent sized dining room upstairs paper covered tables that you can eat in if you dont want to take the food to go
cZVqa-slZjtRbSirbYNrFg 3 great place in da burgh took the whole family sushi yellowtail collar salmon udon mmmmmmm stay away from the wings but a great place on a warm summer night love it
t-51M4FHJAwnGpBQ4i7KAg 5 the best coffeehouse in the burgh hands downif you love starbucks stay away the is not your run of the mill same old same old coffee chain ala starbucks caribou crazy mocha etc etc tt is the one and only and it showsit took more than a year to renovate this south side loft into a very comfortable and neighborhood feeling coffeehouse and you can tell down to the minute details from the real fireplace i am sitting next to as i type to the handmade coffee bar when you first walk in big dog is something better experienced than describedeverything is made fresh on premises including the pastries and soups if you are in the area and looking for a really good cup of coffee or my personal favorite  mocha bianca  stop in you wont be disappointed
-VuT5zitXNDttYF38QFf4g 1 this place has been sold once sold twice sold sold sold and the food has going more downhill than kyle rasmussen at incline village circa 1982 give it a pass
SRSZMo-NciWnrcls2kHGmA 5 without question the best and most authentic mexican restaurant in town were not talking mexico city mexican were talking baja california mexicanthe menu is quite simple and the food is awesome the margaritas are small potent and pricey  but worth itmy favorite dishes include the shrimp cocktail appetizer with chips good for sharing and the mahimahi fish tacos the burritos are huge and also recommended  try the surf n turf wet red sauce it is enough for 2 to share especially if you have startersno reservations are accepted so if you go on a fri or sat night be prepared to have a few cocktails at the baralso if you are a fan of chains like mad mex or don pablos i wouldnt recommend trying azul you will come out of this place saying the prices are too high and the portions are too small if you prefer quality over quantity azul cannot be beat unless you fly to la or head south of the border
rRrP4NIXV7IJitJ13843lw 1 nevernevernever consider this dealership sales department  they should be working at a used car lot in the boondocks  run for the hills  i honestly believe we were racially profiled and gender profiled  they dont respect customers who just want the bottom line  they want to play patty cake and pretend it is negotiations  it is plastered all over their wall literally painted that they respect their customers  i guess if you see and read something everyday you actually believe you are demonstrating those values  sooo not true  find another dealership where they respect the intelligence of women and othersoh yeah  they tried to keep us at the dealership by pretending that we had taken the keys to the test drive vehiclehilarious  only thing i can say is that ruben in service is very committed to customer service  he has gone above and beyond to help my daughter  maybe he can teach the guys in the front about ethics

PIT-zDClSgj0p4nAMGrnLg 5 one of the most wonderful hidden gems in all of europe  youd almost miss it we stumbled upon it accidentally  the owner is extremely welcoming and friendly and will discuss wines and offer tastings  the small bites and apps are amazing  theyll also ship wine internationally in case you fall in love with their own label from their winery nearby
nK701KUNfhHlhgiXf_Aw0w 5 i have shopped here since 1998 when i got back into keeping tropical fish in a live plant environment after a few years offi like that incoming livestock are kept in quarantine after arriving that i can ask to be told when a particular species becomes available that the staff are so knowledgeable and enjoy discussing the hobby even though i notice some impatient shoppers just wanting to grab and go reminds me of the now closed pirrhana on avenue road that was run by a hobbyist or fintastic in the east end run by mikeharold the head guy has saved a couple ailing fish with clear advicejust in case this seems too high a rating keep in mind that i have seen a lot of fish shops since i began the hobby sixty years agoand plant and fish prices seem as fair as elsewhere
NVaXHQhlGibNSr6rshnGgQ 1 here sushi equates to much icecold rice with very skimpy bits of fish on top had to ask waitress for wasabi and ginger and given inadequate amountsalad floating in dressing bland miso soupslow servicea year or two ago one could get a decent lunch here
JUxWD0uif1tPAN-u_aInFw 3 creative cooking modern cool joint with pleasant staff loved the soft small gnocchi with nduja though i found only a tiny morsel of this delicacy in the savoury sauce and my friend enjoyed the ontario perch which is difficult to cook well asparagus side imaginatively broiled and seasoned al dente very yummyoverall very good food and a fresh approach though 25 overpriced on many items  the perpetual problem of focusing on decor that costs  to build ingive it a try i will return despite the cost issue
K0QZ4ed8QxNSDygz_Cy_Zg 3 i am very pleased to have found this restaurant which is several cuts above other pho joints i have eaten in in the past thirty years it starts with brilliant pho broth here is a very complex  low salt highly complex broth  it reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone white lotus on lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years agoanyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth i had the soup last time which brought me back todayi tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork grilled shrimp and spring rolls verdict massive shrimp lightly grilled lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non greasy spring rolls which i dipped in hoisen sauce as an experimentmy bowl of bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balancedoverall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour so i will go again though it puzzles me to see some negative reviewers dissing this place for another pho joint nearby guys stay out of the commercial rivalry and avoid negativity lifes too short
LkMR1Yk9Sjm3XHFOnGopPQ 3 what makes a really goog neighborhood joint for me its not just quality cooking and decent prices its the sense of being welcomed and appreciatedi have been dropping by for lunch three or four days a month often with a friend since the current owners remodeled the former tokyo sushi opposite  st pauls chuch where tafelmusik playsthe food decor and atmosphere have stepped up greatly i have tried many items but my fave is the chef combi with salmon teriyaki and sushi it includes generous sashimi as well many veggie items tooonly a light dinner needed after such a feastno friend has ever disliked maido and my friends are mostly picky foodies anyway its my kind of lowkey friendly place give it a try
2A64xitBSAtCFPZ-4svH7Q 3 having read raves i decided to eat at sea witch on a quiet lunch hour there was  only  one other diner and about five staffno big deal being served  rightnot that there was much effort to break off conversation and speak to me as i waited for a welcome finally ordered and having confirmed with the pleasant cashier that yes i would like tartar sauce i was then asked by two different servers if i happened to want tartar sauce it seems that the staff dont pay much attention i told the last one that i had been asked twice already and received no reply though in the end the sauce was suppliedpacific haddock was tasty but more batter than fish and the chips were lukewarm far from piping hot as they need to be for taste and textureslackness kills reputations the decor and concept are good but the execution left much to be desired
F4QPYzwec6d5B7BE_wSZoQ 1 pleasant staff decent food and fair prices yet what might have been a perfect brunch on a warm summer sunday today  was considerably diminished by many wasps swarming the patio tablesi was told the owners refuses to use wasp traps or even one of the effective fake wasp gadgets that keeps wasps awayits not even an expensive fix to protect diners so whats going on hereits a matter of time before someone gets stung and sues for damagestoo bad but shows a lack of care for customersi down rated the place by two stars for that reason
Q4LtdgbHbud660lBmn2X-g 3 i dont understand why this restaurant has such bad reviews i live next door so i pick up food fairly often everything ive tried has been really tasty general tao shrimp in lobster sauce noodles sushi

jGP_qD_mWEqh53kA0njMHw 1 wayyyyy too much hype about this place seriously though no seriously only good thing about this place is how they are good at making the portions look decent in the photos lolservice the waitress was no offense an airhead she was so distracted looking around at people seemed to have a bad case of adhdshe knew nothing about her drinks list or about the food  was gone when we kept trying to order more food we had to order with the bar back because she took so long to show upfood tater tots   meh not worth it cauliflower app meh over cooked and nothing special corn bread alright but really not worth it  unless you are feeding tweety bird kentucky handshake sandwich not worth the price its literally kentucky fried chicken  like might as well go there and pay 6 instead of basically 15 to look at some arm  lol chicken and waffles  portion is not worth it flavor was alright nothing mind blowing go to the kensington market one  wayyy better and much more for your money  red funnel cake  save your money  tiny over cooked and completely over drizzled with icing  yuck  worst thing i have ever had in the funnel cake departmentwe ordered more food but honestly dont waste your time  just go somewhere else not worth even going on about how bad it was
YGVbjhIL_L-kiVWRVI2JfA 1 service was really great fast quick friendly but the food was a terrible blanco roll was the worst  its like someone squished egg tuna from a can and panko crumbs and made it a roll as if thats not bad enough they make it resemble some back ally hotdog by adding pickled jalapeo to it gross if you like fish cakes and hotdogs this roll is for you if not i highly recommend staying away if they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalapeo over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here volcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish  which is why i go out for sushi the sashimi plater 30 pieces was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon everything else was off temperature complimentary salad was small cute and good the miso soup was good tea was average ginger is really good herewasabi is really weak here i hope the chef seriously considers the suggestion i made about the less sauce and torched raw jalapeo ja bistro has mastered it and its incredible maybe the chef should check it out and see what i mean would not recommend this place will not be coming back
xYd_ZaAxJ5yMCcn18suCtg 5 i was on the phone trying to order with khao san road for over 30 mins calling back over and over again no one picked up called here they picked up on the third ring took my order and had it ready in 15mins with a smile on their faces  that is service worth  great job will defiantly be coming here more often
xlGJkxoIBl8XH8wVsPZpnw 5 always great friendly service and fresh baked bread and desserts everyday highly recommend the custard cakes they are the closest thing i have ever tried to the original pastis de belm in lisboa  the rice flour cake is also really good and a good option for those whom do not like cake too sweet the bean cakes are great here too  orange almond and a few others i have tried are all good cant go wrong with nova era
lHPdv5p1y_fKAen2J_ijVg 1 6 stars i have come here several timesthe staff is friendly however i feel they have not been properly trained in making the drinks they sell the coffee beans are good quality however sometimes the load is packed to tight and the espresso comes out with a burnt taste other times in a latte it is either too over heated or comes out like a cappuccino in the simplest way put very inconsistent and not in anyway good some of the desserts are really over priced for the quality and quantity you are getting ie small almond croissant 420 today i ordered an early grey the earl grey tea i had tasted moldy  it also made me sick which makes me question what type of hygiene they have there will not be going back to this place ever  they are a disgrace to cafes tip go to the starbucks upstairs in the indigo or across the street they are closer to what it should really taste like you will get the coffee late cappuccino or tea the way it should be done
pm-tsg8K6uOx3Q4w3I2okg 1 5 stars literally saw the chef lick her fingers over and over again while i waited for my orange juice then she started setting up peoples dishes  with her bare handsdisgusting place extremely unsanitary after waiting 10mins to receive my orange juice while almost puking watching the levels of sanitation plummet more and more i was then presented with half a cup of juice when i asked to upgrade to a full cup i was then told thats the only amount i can buy okay guess they dont want to make money tip save yourself the nausea go somewhere  else
3_waRRDQRPmAUB5u8g_emg 1 5 stars worst place ever dont bother going here you will definitely regret it save your money for a better serviced hygienic more organized and professional establishment you would think when a party of 40 people are coming they would provide better service considering all the money you just brought into this dump for them no one from that birthday will ever be wasting our time making that mistake again
q5SRaNhsJFkJJJKN1gmgfw 3 really small place to grab ice cream which is fine considering we have more cold weather than summer the ladies who were making the cones were very pleasant and had great vibes the person who was at the cash the first time i went seemed a bit stuck up but then the second time the front cash barista was also very pleasant and seemed to have very good vibes hopefully i see more of this side the following visits too love the cashew latte with the brazilian blend  perfection  ice cream 6 i would say they should be priced more at 4 was good quality for a soft serve it was defiantly not the same quality as mcdonalds or an ice cream truck way better the only similarity is that it melts quickly  like any other soft serve the cones could be a little better quality because they do get pretty soggy at the end  love the creativity they have with the cones i hope they continue to come up with new ideas small suggestion on the cinnamon one maybe add some nuts  the current topping just seems so plain jane compared to the other creative cones you have definitely going back to try more flavours
LjKdXV1xL8_WbttC-BLf2Q 5 all i have to say is  if youre going to get a tattoo and want it done right and like no other place in toronto go see raidel at adrenaline i originally had an amazing tattoo artist in kensington vince who unfortunately moved back to venice italy fate brought me to the hands of the very talented raidel his passion for creative designs and art is phenomenal he has done quite a large amazing piece on me and most of it he just did freehand  that is talent  the thing i love the most about his many talents is the fact that he has something that i find is so rare in a tattoo artist he can create that flow into making your tattoo not look like a stamp  but a part of you an art that can even take previous pieces and make them one i have about 1 3rd or fourth of my body tattooed and this tattoo saviour turned my several prior tattoo pieces ribs shoulders upper back and with his new addition turned my body into a canvas with one solid flowing united piece brilliant engineer in designing     adrenaline is quite pricey but if you are getting it done with him its well worth it if i wasnt so broke ass i would give him a huge tip as appreciation for his very hard work and talent i intend to repay him some day by surprise for the lack of the tip he deserved that i didnt have at the timethis hard working friendly always smiling singing artist will make you never want to go anywhere else with all his talent and positive energy
Y3A4AS0_LEj3RA4nDZ0h0w 5 quick very friendly service this evening she was very welcoming and made some suggestions after knowing it was our first time butter chix creamy subtle kick of butter chicken spice saucy very enjoyable  mums chicken pie  classic  was not disappointed love the touch of chardonnay really gave it that extra little something traditional aussie  saucey  meaty has a little potato not too much which i really appreciate because i didnt have an allergic reaction to it from that very reason  surprisingly even though these little guys are the size of your palm they are actually decently filling   you might just need 24 to fill you up depending on how much you can handle price is okay  about 7 each palm sized pie they have 4 pies for 24 to take home and cook located in the freezer  i feel that is a better suited price for the cooked ones too   on the plus size the hand held sizes lets you try more flavours would recommend people to check it out
qT_J7pEyMS15bDD5c042NQ 1 the only good thing at this place is the friendly staff the food however is terrible save your money i dont know how someone can over cook rice into a mash the curry was literally just curry no veggies or anything and i felt like i was drinking curry soup that was much too creamy and not enough spice also had the tom yum shrimp soup very disappointing it was literally some powder tasting broth with 3 shrimp and a couple mushroom slices not a traditional tom yum at all if they had a 1 star i would have put it
nUyN0JxtAEl1FiaqNoYqkA 5 customer service from both staff today was really great so i ordered the matcha latte  drank it and my stomach turned it is really sweet i dont mind sweet treats but when it comes to beverages i am only a fan of bitter and sour things they happily literally with a smile offered me another beverage i felt pretty bad because i hate wasting but i just can not do sweet drinksfyi their matcha powder has sugar mixed into the packaging they get just like starbucks which would be great  unless you are not looking for a sweet drink great news their soy latte is amazing deep rich coffee bitter flavor which i love i was very pleased by how calm and positive they both were with me as i am sure that was probably annoying to have to waste the product  more coffee shops should have this type of professional positive smiling customer first type of employees location also has a fireplace which o imagine will be nice in the cold winter months washrooms are clean probably because now they arent bombarded with all the school children arroyos the area coming in and disrespectfully destroying it and leaving it messy every 30mins
I8x6dVFeBVGS6XI6ryTQ2Q 5 love love love quantum coffee  100 better then starbucks and done properly lattes cappuccinos and flats oh my   also a few cents cheaper then starbucksbut way better in quality service is always great baked goods are always amazing and super fresh also sent in from local bakeries  did i mention they now have a reward coffee card  thats right starbucks  you have zippoooo on quantum suck my kiss
ql_y3bNefJJHbCKZKm0k3g 5 love the food here always amazing friendly service the atmosphere is good its a very simple place inside out but the food is killer i always come here when i need my korean food fix the pork bone soup is awesome the meat basically falls of the bone perfection the bibimbap is always my go to dish it tastes like the best mothers home cooked meal i love how they are always attentive to make sure you get your pickles and such at the beginning and how friendly and welcoming they are great place to go with a family group as a couple or alone
qO81z1KiEviyr2TEVOXaeg 1 the fish taco is really good burrito boys makes the best burritos this place way too much bread ratio not enough of anything else the other meat tacos  not good meat tastes more like old leftovers from earlier that week lol gross tip if your going only get fish tacos
RO7Ca7ER1Vo06jTlvHCEbw 3 authentic home made curries great tom yum pad thai is good vibes are relaxed music not too loud fills up quick because it is a small resturant staff pleasant
_tfwPkSLgVvhgOgnCtV5mA 1 several unfriendly  unhelpful staff unorganized will not be returningwent in to drop off a prescription staff was rude and when i insisted on leaving my account information she cut me off and told me she would get everything she needs when she contacts the other location to move my prescription over i return 2 days later no phone call left to let me know they were filled i get there and had to wait 30mins for this also unfriendly staff that seems to apparently hate her job to give me my prescription apparently its too challenging for the staff to process a simple refill pickup
DCrp9Y8grxbFbyLa3aN55w 5 late review  wayne was amazing best massage therapist i have ever had hands down unfortunately i found out he no longer works here  now i need to find him
pwINZpmTYiXybGdlRrbEwg 5 use to come here all the time and loved it service needs a little work but more importantly lets get to the food reviews starting with my personal favoriteravioli di zio paperone great homemade ravioli stuffed with duck confit fig roasted butternut squash sauteed with oyster button mushrooms and parmigianotonnarelli alla norcina  good italian black truffle shavings homemade spicy sausage pecorino tagliatelle alla bolognese great traditional bolognese rag parmigiano tonnarelli ai funghi  good oyster and honey mushrooms porcini sauce cavatelli al ragu dagnello great handmade cavatelli lamb braised in tomato sauce pecorino gnocchi alla simi good tomato sauce fresh ricotta basil parmigiano rigatoni arcobaleno  good mozzarella di bufala zucchini light cherry tomato sauce basil agnolotti alla lilli good stuffed with spinach ricotta and pecorino butter sage and parmigianospaghetti in canna a mare  okay fresh clams and mussels calamari scallops and tiger shrimp light tomato sauce apristomaco  appetizers carpaccio di manzo great hand cut raw beef tenderloin lemon juice extra virgin olive oil parmigiano reggiano shavings arugolafunghi assoluti  good basked oyster mushrooms parmigian bread crumbs extravirgin olive oil balsamic vinegar arugola frittura di calamari  okaydeep fried lightly floured calamaritagliere del salumiere good selection of italian and local cured meats tagliere di formaggi  good selection of italian cheeses served with honey and homemade jam insalate  salad only one i have tried is caprese and it was good pizze  pizza they are well done thin crusts  i personally like napoli margherita bufalina quattro stagioni santo stefano da d a d smendozzata li pecuri and finally ct mang dessert  i always get a flourless chocolate cake heated  its a perfect finish for my dinner with a cappuccino or latte
9E1uv1Ijy9LkO461c6m5SQ 1 desserts and bread are always great at nova era customer service is terrible desserts always a great variety and always fresh couple recommendations custard cakes bean cakes are all amazing customer service after waiting in line for 15mins with only two people in front of me i was told to go to the other counter to order my sandwich after ignoring me for another 10mins the extremely rude woman making sandwiches doesnt even greet me and in a very unfriendly manner tells me to basically go sit down and now wait to be asked what i want20mins pass and i am still here sitting and waiting to have someone approach me to take an order i will never be coming back here to eat and highly recommend only coming for the bakery stuff only here terrible fucking service
pmhBXiCYaEyy_D-MgHQmmA 3 performances are great but the crowd and music needs a little work also they shouldnt space out all the wicked performances sooooo far apart
PiQ6nRjJSeuC7tv3uFWklg 3 in cod we trust great deep fried fish toco but fish portion is small beef cheek braised and good portion tuna chive in hard shell toco okay portion  a little too drenched in sauce we had some ribs special of the day portion not worth the price at all  sauce is a type of honey garlic drenched in mayo  not worth the money  i had high hopes for great food here after reading the reviews but was over all not really that impressed
PDf-CtPBHExgz13Ggj1G3g 3 chicken and waffles are awesome and thats about it folks dont bother with the pasta or hamburgers was not impressed at all friendly staff who seemed to disappear after giving us our food  for a long while
64d0b-8YJE8BJNv7Xb9lBw 3 this place is a hit and miss some times the food is really great and flavourful and other times i have ordered food that was over salted or just bland service has been okay portions are a hit and miss for some things i dont think i will be going back after my last visit though
HE0pvZ4rsq0KlDEK4YNnIw 1 do not go here if there was a minus 5 star i would have put that seriously they are gypsies hereyou order sushi for take out they send you with some panko filled rice and drizzle oyster sauce to make it look like eel roll warning they use the worst quality fish too
a7DOMYlMKvike_313Juubg 5 love this place  honestly best burrito in toronto  halibut is tasty simple flaky  brilliant
KW3cBdgVled03ARMevnpHA 1 not authentic at all not at all khao soi  not sure who paid all these reviewers to call it authentic  i am a huge fan of thai food and have never had coleslaw  yes thats right  literally coleslaw in the khao soi it is disgusting beef was not tenderized and undercooked  tom yum  the only average thing worth maybe trying if there is nothing else open and you need food it is heavy on the lemon grass and is missing the fundamental herbs and spices for starters galangal  had no freshness to the soup  tasted like over cooked boiled veggies that had some paste added  choice of meat and severed  curry is not authentic at all  it is a premade paste added again to something cooked separate then served a paste at a resturant considered to be authentic should be made in house and better qualityservice was fast servers were fine music was fine overall poor quality food will not be coming back and do not recommend this place to anyone
6TfdJodXZ94VyV2z3xg-OQ 5 awesome home cooked style food what a little gem we found the outside is a little off putting but once you go in its a completely different situationservice was great  friendly professional classy staff and great priced filling traditional food  cabbage rolls  saucy simple and tasty perigees loved the potato ones schnitzel tender not oily tasty  very fresh ingredients  really satisfied our home cooked craving
RsaRVjJyex_BEDvUCCQ_sg 5 butter tarts really well done they have a bourbon one that is also very good for the liquor lovers chocolate and butter croissants very well done and properly texturized almond croissant was a bit on the drier side macaroonsmatcha  white chocolate  had a strange fridge radiator after taste which i hated and the matcha was too mildly infused earl grey has a chocolate filling which is honestly too overpowering for the bergamot notes red velvet also more chocolate in flavour not quite enough vanilla maybe just the supplier over all there were a few i did really enjoy and would recommend as i would select the following flavours again upon my next visit  100 salted carmel then hazelnut pistachio could be a little stronger but still amazing  lavender boston cream is very true to flavour raspberry and chocolate honestly the last time i came in but not the first three times  but the last time  all my macaroons had a really off putting stomach turning fridge taste as it was the only time that happened i will he going back as i love the lavender and salted caramel macaroons  have yet to try the pies but they look fabulous along with the scones and meat pies cant try everything in one day 
RCcuZSn-_vR1sa-ZVQ-KCg 5 great friendly service was provided they had a sale on so i went a little over board with the shopping and the staff was there to help me find my perfect sizes for everything i needed
J5rAAgTqBd47WX3pma_v-w 1 staff taking orders in such a rush they mess up my order which i only find out 10 mins after watching the barista mess up my drink twice  which she claims someone must have taken  then to complete her customer service the barista then speaks to her coworker and makes me go back to the line to pay the extra 063 cents for the mistake they have made  what a joke where do they find these people never thought i would find such horrible people working at a coffee place as all my past experiences at many other coffee houses have been great tip  save your money for a timmys or other coffee place in the hospital
f0rTZVLTxipXkgoFT7ZoDA 3 i have been here before but my last experience was not good at all the bad  the younger lady who served us seemed like she does not like her job  she made our visit unpleasant right from the entrance  she seemed a little arrogant too and was not very familiar with the desserts i am not a fan of lemon desserts but i do not mind something with a tiny note of it as i know a lot of baked desserts often do have a little in them  when i specifically asked for her recommendation she gave me an extremely lemony dessert i also requested a no foam latte and she seemed to also miss that one as she handed me something that closely resembled a cappuccino i love the heart of this place  it was actually a bit heart breaking with my last visit as i have come in several times throughout the past couple years and have not received this type of treatment the good love the desserts here i usually always grab a mix box of the traditional southern italian almond and pistachio biscuits and am always very pleased with the texture the flavour and the combination of them the bread here is amazing highly recommend you try anyone of them i am sure you will love it  the coffee beans they use here are also very robust and strong which i lovei try to ignore the treatment i got here last time because maybe she was just having a bad day and was taking it out on us but to be honest thats no excuse ever  and it will effect me to now go closer to bathurst and collage to go get my almond pistachio fixes from more pleasant staff
N6uYKO8sow0QoBKpcJZNGQ 5 i really love the butternut squash soup here its one of the things that has always stayed consistent even after the change of hands after the owner passed away  curry lamb wrap  good has a great spicy kick  perfect for winter and autumn days chicken wrap good chicken is tender and cooked simple but well cant go wrong with the chicken steak wrap usually great but last time was way over cooked they need the cook to keep a closer eye on the meat to make sure its still pink on the inside of the beef the fact that it was over cooked made me think maybe they downgraded the meat quality  regardless now i will only be going there for soup
oAs_M1he26KksaaOjzwSQw 5 highly recommend this place if your looking for a dedicated experienced professional who really listens and goes above and beyond to get the job done everyone is extremely helpful positive and kind  i started coming to myodetox after my boyfriend always telling me about how his whole volleyball team loves boris and his magical fixing hands i was not disappointed at first i was going to boris to help with tightness in my hamstrings hips and shoulders results were often immediate and helped me achieve better form and dig deeper in my workouts after my car accident and suffering from some serious whiplash and  a terrible concussion boris really dedicated his time to help me he informed me on what to expect with concussions and whiplash and how to overcome my daily obstacles while being rehabilitated they do a lot of services here its like the one stop shop for anyones needs i have had physio massage acupuncture cupping and even things on vestibular rehabilitation the list really just keeps going i still have a long way to go but i have made some incredible progress which i owe all to myodetox through my experiences thus far i can honestly say myodetox really will bring back the new you
oO7EklMNUuLWKCQCInAiSg 3 quick service  tasty flavourful food the chicken kabob is great and tender tandoori special gives you a nice mix and the beef kabob is also very flavourful and tasty salad could use a little extra something something but is fresh ingredients at least for now great place if you need a quick bite
KYQPmCwO0DPXS-EDb7NBBA 1 suffocation best describes the services given at this location the rep was sooooo annoying she didnt even ask for what we were looking for and kept bringing us what she normally wears in sizes that arent even our size it was like she was having a conversation with herself or something  like every min she brought me something new to try on it made me feel frustrated annoyed nauseated and obviously did not want to buy anything ever from here again i will be going to the other locations from now on to get proper service
cyPaZNZ77Kc2nZas20FqsA 3 food is good fresh house made broth great flavour and not salty like most soups i have at restaurants fair price for quantity and quality of food beef flank soup is really good here service was fast
EVd_tGYKSAI0yyHodvzUxw 5 pricy but really good waffles  good chicken portion lets keep it like that dont turn into home of the brave portions
J-lBbotEfK-CYCReCZqmiA 5 great selection  when in stock they need to get people who understand the products that they sell came in several times and it was hard to find anyone on the third floor who could help me with anything really im pleased with micheals being in the area none the less i just hope for future hires they consider always having at least one person who understands what they are selling the first time i went in for gold leaf paint no one was even around to help out of all the floors i finally managed to find a representative on the third floor once i asked her where i could find it she asked me to wait because apparently she was the only person working and had 3 other people in front of me how can such a large store be so understaffed on a weekend morning i dont know i was very happy to see on my second visit that this has changedthey now have many more reps working the floor unfortunately when i went to ask about some stain glass products again i was not able to get the help i needed from the first representative i was however referred to amanda on the ground floor who was able to answer my questionsservice is definitely getting progressively better   updatewent back a couple more times since and they are definitely getting things more organized i have to say i really love all the 50 off coupons from this place i dont go to any other places for art supplies anymore because of the amazing prices and they stock is unreal
kCieN9PVbrZe40eNYDZM9Q 1 terrible service  terrible over cooked wings literally was like eating dried out oil jerky  not sure how they are still in business tip save your time and money go somewhere else anywhere else will be better
AVutsGbOCKlesul0HrXSFg 5 love love love this place tacos tacos  firstly just need to say i put the habanero hot sauce on everything here to give it a little kick  if you love spice defiantly try it  also rule of thumb squeeze that lime on everything  tacos and in drinks  just go wild shrimp tacos were juicy and great fish taco was great and flaky they had a trout taco day feature which was great with a little lime and hot saucechicken and beef tacos had a decent amount of meat in them and were nicely cooked and shredded the vegetarian option was surprisingly also very tasty and flavourful ceviche love the jalapeo touch inside but fish and tomatoes needs to be chopped up more for better chip grabbing fun margarita pitcher could use a little more lime less agave and more tequila less sweetness and more pungent twist and kick in the mouth to go with those tasty tacos i just ordered extra tequila and added to my cup but i would say about 4 more shots in the pitcher would fix itover all very great vibesmusic is beautiful loud and upbeat friendly staff great place to go grab a bite laugh and enjoy a fun latin vibes time
bDKAD52T5_dWnuTjZwzXgA 3 great friendly quick service the red  yellow and green curries are great  creamy and has a nice flavour red  personal favorite we get this all the time green  little spicier so not recommended for those who do not like spice yellow  good  not spicy
m-xTYOTdkk5dOf4JLnbLVA 5 love love love  great food really hits the taste buds of sea food lovers the best way have been here many a times  love how they change up a lot of the plates always a new adventure  summer nightslobster bisque  creamy buttery not over salty just perfect summer nightsscorpion fish with roasted garlic mash  garlicy creamy perfect mash  fish was flaky tender perfect  severed with a side of roasted crisp veggies ail yearpersonally love the smaller oysters  i usually eat 12  just for me entering springtuna tartar fresh and toasts were a perfect duoautumn seared tuna with a creamy broth was absolutely perfect and the long chipclam chowder  creamy perfection with a little potato
dSJalL-4TmWeuKmY3OdKoQ 1 was very displeased as a regular client of khao san road i have come here for a couple years always in person the other day i tried to order take out i was trying to get through for over 30mins calling over and over and over again i was extremely unhappy with the fact that i was pushing close to an hour with trying to order food i called northern thai and they picked up the phone immediately
-2FCX5wLY9aS7LspKKyo4A 1 really dry ribs pulled pork tasted like watered down sauce was added after cooking mac and cheese was creamy and good not over cooked slaw was good just normal slaw i honestly could not believe how dry my ribs were it was pretty heart breaking as i had been looking forward to going there just for that for sooooo long  brisket was cooked well  for most of the pieces i got because again part of it was dry tipthe sauces are good but they need to leave the ribs in for a longer cooking time seriously tho  please do ribs are suppose to fall of the bone not be like jerky  if i wanted jerky i wouldnt order ribs customer service was great very friendly and helpful this place has a lot of potential to go so far  the major loss of stars for me was because when you are a bbq house that advertises ribs like that i expect them to know it is suppose to fall off the bone
tWodKh9Oopx9uI33IZZ34Q 3 great japanese cheesecake i loved it the only thing they need to figure out is an effective way to get that line moving faster it can be a very long wait  which makes the  whole experience negative for people taking away from the enjoyment of the products
ezOskeLKOq9xd-815hmQsQ 5 my dog is really nervousshaking hiding an occasional growl at the vet  other places i have been the technicians make a comment about her being scared ask questions then leave at countryside the technician went out of her way to try to calm my dog my dog even gave her kisses which she has never done in the 10 years i have been taking her to the vet i wish i could recall her name because she was excellent dr hoppe was wonderful and knowledgeable and made our visit quick and easy without trying to add any tests or procedures that werent needed because my dog is so nervous she is often overlooked as being a good girl so i appreciate the nice words that dr hoppe said about her the free hugs and kisses on the bill is also a nice touch thanks for the good experience

Y_vlOS7oz46FByC6b8O2Yg 1 i was unfortunately very dissatisfied with my visit after having been recommended by more than one person for their thai food the pad thai and massaman dishes were bland and lacked many key ingredients the pad thai was particularly sparse lacking leeks raddish and especially the bean sproutsand it isnt pad thai without bean sproutsin short isnt worth the wait or the hype
NCA0f9TWRPnYm_n0Pnh5EQ 1 do not use this company    the owner is rude obnoxious self absorbed and if the lack of business is any reflection of the work they do no cars  no repairs not busy ever  then that should tell you  all  you need to know  whenever you walk into a company and there is nothing going on  then you should be suspicious  this guy needs a course in customer service  but it wont matter  doubt he will be open long enough   do not use  dont subject yourself  plenty of other quality caring busy automotive repair places right nearby   pass this one over 
Hlz9V3Zm-ti9pdiv8TvtZg 5 best fried chicken i have ever had we went for brunch and started with the fried green tomato blt it was so delicious and unique next i had the chicken and waffles and my husband had the plain fried chicken we both agreed it was the best fried chicken ever the cocktails were delicious and so were the mimosas i wish we had saved room for desert service was excellent and i loved the ambience

WguHfuOz_vK0b9mPZmfEbg 3 we came here for brunch on a monday  pretty tasty food  great selection of both brunch food and regular dinnertype food  the price was much better than i expected it to be for a vegas buffet around 24 and it included a free mimosabloody marychampagne  the decor is amazing complete with great hanging glass installations in line with the rest of the cosmopolitan hotel theme  definitely try out the desserts especially the great selection of gelato and the chocolate covered strawberries as well as the macaroni  cheese
cf9RrqHY9eQ9M53OPyXLtg 3 came here for lunch after a long night of partying  im a huge fan of french food and had definitely been craving it ever since i arrived at ph and saw that the paris was next door  mon ami gabi definitely satisfied my craving  a friend and i split the steak classique steak with butter and the quiche lorraine  so good  the steak was perfectly cooked medium rare as requested  the quiche lorraine was delicious but i was so full by the time i got around to eating it that i only had a few bites what i did eat was perfectly balanced  my friends seemed to enjoy their orders as well  i only wish that the restaurant served steak tartare i wouldve been on that like white on riceside note the bread is served warm and crusty the way it should be  i wanted to eat the whole baguette myself not to lie but highly disappointing was the cold butter definitely worth coming here for a meal that is nice but not too nice im looking at you 16course tasting menu at jg when youre in vegas
FRLE_GCPac5oPoZ37jHQrw 1 i want to like this place so much  the food that we got was delicious the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is tdf but the service we got was horrible  our server was fineshe was upbeat and tried to work with our wants but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible  to be fair we were a large group about 14 or 15 and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group let alone trying to get our food out at the same time  honestly i could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people i had been sitting with  before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte the restaurant pushed us into this tasting menu that would incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishessounds fine but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have very varied tastes that is almost impossible to do  to begin with some of our group members didnt eat any raw fish and others were basically only interested in raw fish  we eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue fighting  they tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame grilled shishito peppers and fried green beans to start  great and thanks but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here if this rating were about the food only i would give it 5 stars  the food really is delicious and the decor while strange goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for  the pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it  the appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring its spicy but not in the givememilktoguzzlenow way  the sushi that we were served however was pretty substandard  im sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point which somehow got haggled down honestly i did not come to sushisamba just to get spicy tuna rolls i could get that anywhere in short come here if youre in a small group  the food really is worth it many times over  im sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one i had in a large group
UWCpDwgwPzn8fLCJc-Aqcg 1 so noisy we could not have a conversation   asked to be moved   there was a table available but not for us   no accommodation made  we left  wont return
mv93vAkc7B-VOy12JxBCyQ 3 love their foodi went for their mac and bacon dish and it was yummythe butter chicken that my husband had was so good too would be nice to have more chicken in it but other than that the food rocked waitress was great and she looked busy since it was packed house when we came in on tuesday night since it was wing night
CZUQQoqZEFt2XrMgHfnjOw 3 i heard raves about onion rings being so good i was a bit disappointed when i tried their onion rings it tastes oknot terrible but no seasoning to it i like the aws onion rings the best crispy and firm at most aws peters were simple and bland maybe a bit like back in the 50s  the burger was ok it looked to be put together as an after thought and squished the good thing is the variety milkshake flavours that was what i was into but for me the milkshakes didnt have enough of that dairyice cream flavour for me it was good but not giving me a wow factor it didnt taste like real ice cream shake to me i wont rave about it but dont hate it there its not a place i would want to go as top thing to do when in the area food is decent though
Lze-XxG6wk112h_dnmPwzQ 1 the food was good but the service was terrible there was no spoon for my coffee they ran out of spoons they said the waitresses arent too friendly either they were busy with their cell texting and i had to wait a while for my coffee to be refilled i was pretty much ignored for most of the lunch wont go again due to poor services also my home fries were burntdry other than thatthe egg benedict was good
Bpvqrm8fas_o5cM8Jp5N3A 3 we went there with our 9 and 11 year old we didnt feel too welcome at all by the manager because we bought our 2 girls with us who behaved very well and it felt too upper class to even go there with kids even if they are older not a place to go with kids even though kids are allowed the lasagne was good but a bit burnt on top which i didnt like the alfredo pasta was flavourless not too good was disappointed that they had no pizza for a month when we went there the waitress was sweet but the manager ignored us and went for the people who looked like they had more money to spend and talked to them about the variety of wines there was a sign when i came in that said something like no hats allowed or take off your hats that was fine with me but a bit taken aback by that sign which kind of set the negative tone in a sense dont think i would go again because it felt like setting a foot in a strangers house and felt awkward there food was good though but hard to enjoy myself
o_HLw5STQZ5WNLg4ZpfP1g 3 my daughter and i are both picky about the sushi she loves this place hands down so we only go here when the craving for sushi hits the food is just amazing and delicious my daughter often orders two plates of california rolls her fave rice is good and food is just right not over or under cooked at all i love their good prices not even overpriced at all  the waitress was very sweet and nice hubs asked for extra pickled ginger and got that
AmDKzAWJJ8vsYJ36OhnvaA 5 we live out of town and really just needed some place to watch our dog while we had lunch since it was too hot to leave him in the car we decided to get him groomed and had a great experience the staff was friendly and did a great job the price was cheap compared to other places they called when our dog was ready to be picked up and we told them we would be another 30 minutes until we could get there that wasnt a problem
STdRfSO1D_i9BKePNu8qVQ 3 this is a nice offleash dog park there are plenty of spots to sit while your pup plays theres not a ton of shade which was fine for our visit in late october but i imagine its miserable in the summer the park is separated by weight there was a third area not being used due to maintenance my reviews is only 45 stars because its kind of a small park it certainly does the job though
bRIMnNkLB3h3zz4D4_g4AA 1 took our 2 dogs for grooming here while the groomer was nice he did an awful job he had burnt the side of one of my dogs necks there was burn scabsfor weeks afterwards i let the groomer know he apologized and said ill use a different gaurd next time we gave him another chance and this time the burn marks were even worse he had two huge scabs on both sides of his neck my dog was shaking the entire way home i am not one to write reviews but had to in hopes that it might safe another dog having to go through this i cant imagine how im gonna take him to another groomer hes been traumatized
T2ThVT-bvl1jTEQKlv47Dw 5 i have been successfully treated by dr xiao for 2 very different conditions1 i suffered a ctd  rsi handwrist injury due to my profession  rehabilitation doctors are not trained to detect minor amounts of inflammation and use a pain scale of 110 to quantify a patients condition or use expensive and uncomfortable diagnostic tests  for a minor inflammatory condition hand therapy and antiinflammatory medicines were the prescribed course of action  unfortunately a minor onset of more inflammation from overuse is not detectable by the hand therapist either who is also trained with the pain scale  dr xiao is an expert detecting minor amounts of inflammation and could identify both where and how i sustained it  she used a combination of deep tissue diagnosis and healing massage herbal remedies and acupuncture to remove the inflammation  now i am working with both dr xiao and the hand therapist to build muscle and function  i have regained a tremendous amount of strength and am well on the way towards a full recovery2 i had a persistent skin irritation lasting over a year that my dermatologist could not identify and prescribed steriodal creams for  dr xiao recognized it right away as an energy imbalance in the liver channel  she used a combination of herbal remedies and acupuncture and cleared it away permanently after 4 months of treatmentsshe is easily one of the best diagnosticians and practitioners that i have ever met and she truly loves her work  i cannot say enough about how she has dramatically improved my life
dMBcrImAIPms06PxViZ-7A 5 i had a vacant rental house with pet odor that a competitor carpet cleaner washed twice to eliminate the odor throughout all of the carpets  desperate not to have to do new carpeting i found spotless carpet care on the internet and called steve  he came over right away and knew exactly how to search for the problem spots using a black light the prior cleaning company was not trained with this technique  he found nothing on the surface as the carpet had been previously washed but gave me a great deal to wash it on his own as he had high confidence it would workwhen he came to clean he was on time and very professional  the cleaning was very thorough and brightened quite a bit even after the previous cleanings  i would definitely recommend him for pet owners or landlords that have to clean carpets after someone with pets leaves the property

U4-3icgEqGrD8t0FHBDq4g 5 i recently had an interior paint job of bedrooms bathrooms trim and touch up done through a competitor  the price seemed to float higher and higher even though i thought we had reached an agreement on the work to be done  needless to say it left a bad taste in my mouth and some of the touch up looked terrible  i called david and he was incredibly helpful and sympathetic to my situation  i bought a couple of gallons of paint and he made the most of the situation on a limited budget  the house now looks fabulous and i will not hesitate to use him again thanks david

BlnwfpnPAnI_dZPCnlOioQ 5 dr andy dr patty dr jeff and the entire team has dramatically improved my spinal alignment on a permanent basis  yes i said permanent  its not just them its their combination of great talent compassion and a top notch methodology chiropractic biophysics  i used to get migraine headaches 12x per monthother talented chiropractors would be able to alleviate the symptoms after onset but then it would come back again in a few weeks  since treating at pivonka chiropractic  i have had 2 in a year and the severity has been much less than before  i used to have swallowing problemsthis has also all but disappeared  my shoulders could not relax  now they do  i was so impressed i sent my entire family  fyi this form of chiropractic is not for those looking for a quickfix  it requires serious commitment but i promise that the gain in your quality of life will be well worth it

GGDQQTA5pPEDBteCTIchNw 1 not impressed  i took my cavalier king charles in today and gave them specific instructions about shaving his belly and legs and giving him a trim on top  not only did they not trim his belly but it looks like they just washed him put a scarf on his neck and called it a day  we will be seeking a different groomer in the future  its slightly cheaper than other groomers but who cares if your dog doesnt look right  also the shop seems a little haphazard in how its run dogs running around everywhere in a small space
-CTn_Wyc0K5bTDMm_MnE5A 5 ordered my wifes birthday cake last minute and they worked with me to make it beautiful  thank you freeds
r25Ezdb_141mqnb3XZebCA 1 my friends and i went into grand lux cafe at the venetian for a late dinner and drinks  the food was ok our server was reasonably pleasant but the night manager matt timms when questioned about the cost of an item on our bill was so off the charts rude my friends and i will never come back  mr timms even went so far as to threaten to call my girlfriends employer to make her look bad when he learned we were locals  ive never seen someone lose their cool like that especially not a manager  there are many better options for restaurants within this casino  beware

ALW4S0eMi6PStOvxkOmYwQ 5 this is our place  they just started all you can eat sushi too  order the volcano roll
fyVtCd2QlFxtVdtEFnu8Xw 3 pretty cool place  a little hole in the wall bar  had a fun time with friends but we had to move tables because they were about to start trivia night  man those guys take that seriously  it was packed with trivia people
dfa66f-q8ddn97B4Cw96kg 3 it was ok  got my gas and the people were a little rude  but it is a gas station
QI4FDz5aIF6a5u25sVYYPg 5 just had lunch here with my wife  french onion soup  amazing  parisian sandwich  8 out of 10 crepe dessert with caramelized apples  9 out of 10 atmosphere  very very cool  great date place

3FUYVgTPwB0GJwEPnGidog 5 these guys did a video for our wedding entrance a it was perfect  exactly what we wanted and they worked with us on price and schedule  totally recommend  theyre the best
puPpmo26KHnA7kR3zqjfjQ 5 me and my sons favorite place  get the ecuadorean tamales and seco de pollo  apple soda is great toops  expect slower service because it is truly mom and pop  if you go in with this attitude youll really enjoy the experience  if you want quick timely servers that ask you how food is every 30 seconds you may want to try olive garden or something
Pi4vTYGeS7HkfCRU0aJ8jA 5 great little atmosphere to work or meet with people  im not a big coffee guy so cant tell u if thats good or not  but i enjoyed it and the place just has a great feel to it
shZ5L7rzG6AaHOdtMJ9UuA 5 i searched high and low for a good salon near me even driving out to glendale  peoria and found exactly what i was looking for at chace salon thorugh christina  christinas the best use her and youll have no regrets  you can simply explain what you want to her and shell figure out how do cut and style so that it complements your featuresand the price is beyone reasonable for a great hair cut
9UULO-2CbfTuM3GrRxwSSg 5 i had my big olde english sheepdog groomed here and they did a fine job and the price was on par with everyone else actually i think the price is about 10 more but ill pay the extra money because of the extra service this place providesi really appreciate that they have a pet taxi bc of this service my dog gets a ride home for free but we did tip the driver since i have a little child its hard for me to bring my dog and pick him up on the days i would have time to pick him up so the taxi is worth it for me bc of this service i can now drop off my dog before i go to work and my husband on days hes caring for my daughter can be home to let my dog inside this is easier for me than having to bring my 100 dog inside while holding my babyshaunas is right next to mountainside fitness its right in surprise so if you live in surprise this place will be easy to get to i also thought the service was great too ill definitely be taking my dog back here the next time he needs to get groomed
1-RDYuXP-Fch8Vdmy4g-WA 5 best sandwiches ive had in a long time and theyll deliverif you fall in their small delivery zone 1 sandwich to you this comes in handy for me while im at work and hungry i love the bread  their mayo yum i usually order the beach club no complaints from me
0Fb_M1kI7pR11lxPgQPlfA 3 i joined this gym after leaving fitness 1 this gym isnt perfect but is as close to perfect as i could ask for i like the long hours the gym provides for daycare and daycare will change dirty diapers and for the most part i really do like the gym daycare employees except i had an experience where the daycare manager was extremely rude but i forgave that one instance because i figured she was having a bad dayi also enjoy the towel service  the equipment is great the classes seem great though i have yet to attend a class but i wish the gym would add free wifi for members to use while working out so that i can watch netflix while working out add some more channels to the equipments tvs i wish they would add e bravo mtv and add a laundry shoot for towels inside the locker rooms i even put in a request for the laundry shoot but mountainside obviously just ignored my request i also wish this location  all other locations would have a water service that they provide in their scottsdale location it seems like the west valley is constantly getting the short end of the stick and this is another example of that isnt it  might be wrong but i think the scottsdale location also has better tv channels than the surprise gym doesbut despite those gripes im still a fan this is the best gym in surprise
JT8uWAavADrlWzXQ6mQUQA 3 id give this place 3 12 stars if i could because to me this place isnt blow your socks off delicious instead its just good enough look when im craving pho im glad i have a place close by to order from however its just not as good as im used to back home i think my problem is it doesnt taste as authentic as im used to this place to me seems like its trying to be asian fusion like pei wei or pf changs when i just want pho nothing fancy just phothough i did think the spring rolls were awesomebut nonetheless it does fulfil my cravings without me having to drive 45 minutes so im happy about that
RMB8LFNBKlWML_A_jS-yMg 3 i love it herebut you really need to order the all you can eat because the portions on the plate of meat are too little for the amount youre paying  the all you can eat is around 25  person  everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it if you order the all you can eat then you dont have to pay extra for rice which you really shouldnt have to do if you put in an order for meatbut thats just my opinionseoul grill recently revised their menu so there are more options for different meats they have added different flavors which are so yummy try to spicy pork belly sam gyop sal that was recently added its one of my favoritesand remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat   i must say its really nice not having to drive to koreatown for a decent korean bbq placeoh and all the people who work here are so nice  helpful i wish they would make a seoul grill in surprise we need a korean restaurant in surprise
Enh1GOGSRzLTDgJLqemvig 5 im so glad i found this salon after getting my hair burned last year  then finding out that hair city in phoenix closed i wasnt sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened i even debated driving out to la to get my hair done in koreatownbut luckily i received a referral to cleos from a korean restaurant and so i went here and am glad i didi got my hair magic straightened aka japanese straightened and the stylist did a great job although my hair didnt come out perfectly i blame myself because i recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair and bleach plus magic will frizz hair i learned this from the stylist at cleoi have to give extra credit to the stylist at cleo because he kept asking me if i had used bleach in my hair for highlights and i kept telling him no but he kept asking so i finally called the salon where i had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting unsure why they didnt use regular color since i was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow and now my new highlights are turning yellow too i think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair im really glad the cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair otherwise i would have had a hair disaster this year like i did last year and no i did not have highlights on my hair last year last year my hair was in perfect condition no treatments had been done on my hairi also saw that cleo has machines for digital perms too i might have to try this next year after i grow my hair out since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last yeargo here get your hair done by an expert he told me he was trained in both korea  japan so he speaks korean japanese  english i believe magic straight costs about 150 at least thats what i paid and digital perm costs around 130
Bija_xwliHwqj5CSVYTcmg 5 im always complaining about the lack of customer service in arizona but if you go to pleasure paradise salon you will not have any customer service complaints  believe you mei also had the best massage by kimber im always having neck  upper back pain because of stress  taking care of a young baby but kimber gave my upper back so much attention that i finally found relief in my back and everyone from was so nice one stop shop for hair body  nail care
S9lAaQEDzM38K5uy6pbrjw 1 helens was terrible  i got magic straight at helens i think i paid 150 ish and she did not know what she was doing   kept blaming me and kind of made me feel stupid my korean was not on par with hers  then when i called to tell her it didnt come out she had me come in again  attempted it again but given she doesnt know what shes doing obviously it didnt come out  she also laughed when i asked her to cut my white husbands hair  told me to go to a white salon  i thought she was really rude  hair city is waaaaay better  623 8470308hair city has on multiple occasions successfully straightened my hair hair city did give me a funky hair cut once
z8-lzyD_JoAdC-j9w6LmlQ 5 best insurance agency specialiazed in auto home life  business insurance
W83ylz0dXtL_5YksYtkBag 5 family owned  mike and kelly owners are both very nice and both know their stuff its nice going to a repair shop that i trust isnt taking advantage of me and its nice walking in and speaking to the owners great customer service every time i go to one of those other repair shops they come up with a list of stuff to fix  and when i check in with my father in law or friends they tell me those repairs are not necessary for my vehiclesgo here and you can trust what mike  kelly say
0Gt4cXuT7A0KZ_7nt-nU0g 3 ive been a member here for 4 or 5 years  i only pay 9  month and the gym had everything i need that is until i had a baby  look you know what youre getting at this gym  its kind of a no frills but cheap gym thats clean enough so it worked for me during these past yearsthe daycare hours that the gym are ok but the daycare workers dont change a babys dirty diapers and instead page the parent which is disruptive to a workout  also the daycare hours for me dont start early enough  so im sad to say im going to be switching to another gym probably at the new year  but i did enjoy working out at fitness during the past 45 years  and all the gym workers are so nice and quick to help out with any billing issues of which i have had too many  so i am sad to be switching  but need to so that i can work out around my  my babys schedules
bKOvYg4vMVSjxYIwHUPQbQ 3 went here to celebrate my anniversary food was good but not lick the bowl clean good for the amount of money we spent i think we could have done better but the meal was fine service was great dessert is to die for pound cake  chooclate fondue enough said i agree with other posters who suggest just going for dessert the food isnt worth the price
CuDBtUETFntmgIUZLlPA4w 1 this used to be my favorite nail salon in surprise  but i think they changed ownership in fact i saw that they changed ownership at least thats what theyre advertising in the surprise weekly  anyway i received a white tip pedi from a new tech female  she did not paint even  lines  and when i looked at my toes the lines were a mess and did not match one another  some were lower some were shorter  its hard to explain but  my toes did not resemble one another  i asked if she could fix the lines  and she had to redo the lines and still couldnt get it rightlook getting a pedicure is a service and i want it to look nice  and the fact im paying extra for the white tip i feel like they should get it rightive been getting pedicures for years and have never complained  anyway it was obvious i wasnt happy the manager kevin came and looked at my pedi and told me it looked fine to him  they know me at this salon  i think even if they thought i was imagining the concerns which i was not i think they should have had another tech redraw the lines or comp something to make me feel valued  instead they made me feel worthless as a customer by telling me there was nothing wrongso i got upset passed on the manicure paid for the pedicure and leftive been going to this nail salon for years i think 2 years  they know me at this salon  and to question me when im upset about something just doesnt make me happy  im not going back to this salon
p9qeAnI-Di9WFqlu_LREuA 5 ive had 3 treatments so far from sabrina and love it her prices are great  shes super nice  attentive to boot great customer service shell rearrange her schedule as much as she can to help accommodate my sometimes hectic schedule sabrinas customer service is so much better than the other laser place ive been to
xBTwFReoyxfLcYwoS_FnRg 3 the girls who work here and provide the services such as waxes or massages do a great jobbut the customer service from the girls at the front desk is awful so terrible i dont want to go here again like those girls are so snotty and rude im unsure why they think thats how they should be doing their job
nTf7s720IRC6bweUyFXZuA 5 excellent service and experience all around sometimes you can tell the quality of a restaurant by how they handle the simplist things  their prime rib sandwich with au jus dip was perfect and tender highly recommend
wrv3mDXn34amHQNZ_NyDIw 5 we have been going to phoenix for sometime now but only recently learned of joes farm grill we tried it out and let me tell you it was awesome their portions were just right and even though i was full when we left i didnt feel gross like i do at other restaurants i had the bbq chicken pizza and i loved it thin flatbread crust made for a light pizza very tasty pizza my wife had the chicken caesar salad she gets that salad so often that she knows her caesars and she said this was her favorite dressing and the chicken of course was amazing as well
1pzcYOQv6DSw_ExRGPqRPA 5 ive been to see dr tom nguyen for the past few years  he explains things clearly hes friendly and is willing to take the time to answer questions  he does the cleaning himself which means that you get more time with your dentist  the cleanings have always been free of any significant pain as little discomfort as a trip to the dentist can be anyway  he has never suggested any costlyunnecessary procedures which id recently heard can happen and im glad that he noticed some gum recession and suggested that i see a periodontist to prevent problems in the future  appointments have always been easy to get  all in all a great dentist
1YMOM49lC_MGXYa2HXCX2A 5 hirut is great  delicious food friendly staff a downtoearth feel  i couldnt ask for more  its my favourite ethiopian place in town i think partly because it doesnt feel like it is trying hard to be great it just is  i havent been for any live events but i love the idea that they do this
5mnfbnAWS1YlanNl1l7DqQ 3 i am giving 4 stars for the coffee otherwise it would only be three my croissant tasted dry and as if it was made a few days ago however i could tell it was yummy i find it very difficult to find a good cup of coffee out of my house and neighborhood since we are spoiled in the bay area sure enough they actually use a bay area roaster equator and it was great and quite the relief
R9fs85b354hXFU3Q-phHfw 5 i rarely leave reviews that being said i have to let the world know that ciarra not only gave me the best facial i have ever had she also managed to make me relax enough to enjoy it i have a hard time relaxing her amazing personality put me right at ease you can tell right off the get go she knows what she is doing and she is a beautiful person
hGEpM4ndT2NnUyrTp7TpUg 1 we ordered the 2 fish combo and fish burrito i found the best idem to be their cocktail sauce over priced small portions
FCri17bAg8ZgeKui4qbyOw 3 we went there on our anniversary this year on december 6 th i was concerned after reading the reviews from different sights wow were we happy we ignored them  excellent service and the food was perfect miriam i think was our servers name  and she was fantastic i did feel the prices were high or should i say  higher than i want to pay but the lady has put up with me for 48 yrsso i think she deserved it the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is for the prices 
aAZx8qzkle7T8lhvADAKdA 5 what a great spot and atmosphere oh and their beer is some of the best az stuff around cant wait to day drink there
3nRIwp83jG_Hg4RVwW4yow 5 i am in love with this place today was my first time and we need one in tucson immediately the parking lot was packed and just as i was about to get irritated i noticed there is complimentary valet service que  fancy the inside is super casual and clean and the staff was awesome we didnt get to sit outside in the crazy cool and dog friendly patio i saw a dog sitting on the a table outside i ordered from the 10 brunch menu food plus 10oz beer or mimosa i had the breakfast wrap the wife had the breakfast flat bread i recommend both my girls had chicken tenders which were actual chicken with a tasty fried covering they loved their food too if you have kids a dog and hankering for good food you owe it to yourself to come here
S95ZsFVPVVCbKgDz1zSIVA 3 this place has 2 sandwiches cheese steak and cheese chicken there are some small eats for kiddos but you owe it to yourself to stop here after a long ikea hike the bread is what seals the deal for me i had the chicken with cheese whiz and buffalo sauce nailedit the staff was also crazy nice no five stars only because i thought they served other types of sandwiches too
e18hIQjHUnz5WMVLOzdqrA 5 a must stop on your way back from vegas i had the huevos rancheros with their signature green chili and pork so good the portion to price ratio was a nice return to normal coming from the land of a 10 beer on the strip 30 minutes away the eggs were cooked just right and the pork green chili was smothered over the fried tortillas and beans if you like green chili and solid breakfast food you have to take the very quick detour into the historic downtown area im sure there is a wait almost every weekend but that will give you some time to do some antiquing ill definitely be going back
mfr2EkkhefzEUi_h-QVeIw 3 this theatre is the ultimate splurge  from the comfy recliners complete with blanket and pillow in the premium seating to the fantastic wait staff you couldnt ask for a more luxurious way to watch a movie  being able to book online and have reserved seats is very convenient  yeah its expensive total of 250 for premium seating and dinner for 5no alcohol involved but is worth it for a nice evening out with friends once in awhile
9Tbqg3Nv7EyLxUv-ABfjwA 5 bought a used beetle at a dealer out of state and had a small problem with it on the way home  called san tan vw service department the next day and was pleasantly surprised how friendly the people were on the phone  i took the vehicle there the same day and was greeted by jeff aguilar in service who looked at the car and called me within the hour with the diagnosis  the next day the car was ready fixed right and freshly washed they even worked with the dealer in california that i bought the car from for payment  i will be bringing the car back for regular maintenance without hesitation  thanks and keep up the good work
3-a39qIXT4hzhcdBsIo9Gw 1 went tonight for a quick dinner which turned out to be over an hour  nice decor very clean but the very slow service 40min wait for our entrees was way too long  never saw the waitress again after we placed the order until it was time for the check  when the food arrived it was only lukewarm and despite my attempt to flag down a waiter to refill our drinks we were basically ignored  cant see this place lasting any longer than the other places that have been it this location will not return
W03Dt6ZVOmbJvjOiaUvbIg 5 called adam to tint my vw beetle  he called back immediately with a quote and even beat the current groupon price plus he comes to you which made the deal even sweeter  the car came out fantastic and he cleaned up all the overspray and left the car cleaner than it was  highly recommended thanks again adam
wgr_hOfIWlXR-glOC-qKYQ 5 kudos to charlotte motor speedway they took a situation that was less than idea at the all star race and turned it into a customer service win here is what happened i used ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the all star race i browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in chrysler section k when we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section i didnt remember seeing anything on the website i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way i searched i missed the one on the main page or on my tickets i was told to go exchange my tickets the gate the employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the ticketmaster system so i would have to go to gate 4 at this point im not pleased but i head to gate 4 i show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else after about 20 or 30 minutes im informed by someone who i assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date at this point we have missed about a 14 of qualifying we head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here he said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong at this point im furious so we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone elses seats luckily we werent as most of them around us filled up upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said i did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience way to go cms even though we regularly attend races here you now have a customer for life
b-kks4f8tVGvWsN8oIw3OA 3 i have eaten here quite a few times and the food is good the 2 stars is because they no longer have limestrying to get a response i ordered a margarita ultimate which was very good and when i asked for a lime the bartender said they had stopped ordering them because they were too expensive now granted this didnt make or break my meal but that was one of the strangest things i have heard it wasnt like it was 2 margarita night 9 to be exact hopefully someone in management will see this and respond if you like a lime with your margarita or your mexican beer you may want to pass until they they make a better business decision
UqVQ_SeN6WQ9zuz0gz4FrQ 5 we are regulars but tonight we tried korean short ribs which were amazing  if you havent tried this place the sushi and everything else is so good

oj03nFMkiq-9H-8Lx2ucXA 1 terrible customer service  was looking to buy an evoque  the salesman was totally arrogant  and the sales manager wouldnt budge on the quoted price even though i could get the same car in scottsdale az for 2k less  i just wanted an extra 500 off  nothing crazy  i was basically told that they know they are the only game in town  only land rover dealer for hundreds of miles and i was just going to have to take it or leave it  after getting totally pissed and deciding that ill just buy the car and get screwed on a bad deal they tell me that it is getting late saturday 4pm and that even if i buy the car  right now  they cant delivery it to me today because they dont have enough time  ill have to wait till next week to get the car i am standing right in front of  what  what kind of low budget garbage is that  ive never tried so hard to give someone 54k  im done with these guys  taking my business and money somewhere else what a joke

tUhbIopodnnYyAYc6s-dcQ 5 this by far the best sushi in the valley no joke everything is to die for the sushi chefs are amazing i like to sit at the bar here even though i usually opt for a table elsewhere their menu of specialty rolls is a bit intimidating i admit but just let them know what you like and theyll make excellent recommendations i must say the sauces are beyond anything ive ever tasted if it were socially acceptable i would pick up the plate and lick it clean im not exaggerating theyre heavenly perfection and unlike no otherplease be aware there are no prices on the menu apparently it changes based on market fish prices and it can be a bit pricey if i lived closer id be there all the time seriously no matter where you live its absolutely worth it

H1NACCrp6aPFNvkihQOJ_A 1 worst food and service ever my boyfriend took one bite of their so called steak sandwich and said dog food my boyfriend is nicer than i am seriously i doubt my cat wouldve eaten it what really got me however was the fact that when we politely informed the staff we were questioned 3 times about why it wasnt good now i could have been straight up honest and flat out rude about it but it not our style the man who questioned us could have been a manager but since he never identified himself he could have been anyone i suggest the zipps staff eat it themselves and find out exactly why its worthy of sending back dont bother when in the same complex there are truly excellent places to spend your money
yBmT9s5J3lD4VGJ6lEeJHQ 5 i love this place great service and amazingly delicious chinese food the sweet n sour chicken is my favorite ive never had it better and ive eaten at a lot of chinese restaurants i also love the vegetable fried rice lemon chicken and wonton soup ive seen reviews that are unfavorable and to each his own but really i dont know what the hell theyre talking about this place rocks and does so consistently

oMiDnAGwPm-R-TvKsArzZw 5 great food and service came here for a special occasion large variety of food on the menu will come again 
MeUWNVQW4pMk_9mkZZ7pFQ 1 im mostly reiterating what other have said but with a few additionsgeneral bad ventilation with pittsburgh humidity it gets hot wooden walls so theres not a lot of grip for smearing price for a day pass is reasonable but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateralbouldering area decent number of routes and variety stiff trampoline floor movable pads are big and effective but they arent everywheretop rope areathe top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area which is weird ratings are labeled as easy moderate and hard with  why not put real yds ratings for whatever reason the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops so you dont get much friction while lowering  therefore they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope not a big deal i just havent seen that requirement in a gym before nonsensical rules i got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks i passed the belay test but i was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so i could belay him  i was told this was for insurance purposes as they dont want anyone but the employees teaching i waited for the employee to look away so i could safely set up a top rope  discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to memaybe im just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in san francisco where i live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating
ASYpI7sB2F5qOKiZG2NR6w 3 we werent planning on visiting here but saw a billboard they work saying jerry seinfeld was on that night and we just couldnt miss out that opportunityso we ended up with seats towards the back but the view was still great along with the acoustics would make for a great venue to see some live acts in as well
_aDHL5U-jGHM7TlZkfzUcA 5 to be honest at first i didnt want to stay here as it seemed like it might be a bit tacky but after being recommended by a few good friends we decided to book in as part of our us trip for 3 nightshow wrong i was upon entering the driveway it was just wow all of the way the reception was massive and they had plenty of staff ready to book you in the only one downside was that we had to go into a smoking room which did have some smell left to it but was gone in a matter of hours and reception did tell us we could change later that afternoon if it was still badthe room was very spacious and the bathroom was huge the resort is massive and trust me it will take you some time to explore the gym had a great setup and has plenty of equipment no waiting like at the gym back homewe gave the buffet a go and just like everyone said its a must visit they make just about anything there and have heaps of options to choose fromall up well worth the stay and couldnt believe the price compared to other hotels in the usaps the blinds in the room operate by a switch  we spent a while trying to force them open haha
XN1OyFgh0Nf1BRsyFacoeA 5 i read a lot of reviews about this buffet so on our last day i made sure to drop in as we were staying at the bellagiooh my god this place was awesome not only did it have the widest choice of options i have ever seen at a buffet the quality and presentation was like a top restauranthighly recommend going here if youre after a good feed plenty of healthy choices as well but i must admit i gave in to quite a few of those tasty pastries 
Q-tP0blPQ43taEL9hSJMUQ 3 nice casual bar located in the aria hotel to be honest i went here thinking it actually had a view across the city still a good find and its a nice open bar with plenty of seating and some great drinksjust a word of warning the free snack include wasabi peas didnt realise what they were at first but they made us go through our drinks pretty quick when we did
6yHuhqxM9akiyq3ZVcdrwg 3 great spot for a quick treat if youre staying at the bellagio we had some of the pastries which tasted fresh and like something straight from a bakerythe only downside was that the cafe was positioned on our walk back from the pool to the lifts 
NZXayLIC5wMT63QBkAVqOw 5 outside seating thats truly differentas we were only in vegas for a few nights we wanted to make sure we got to experience as much as possible  including the dining after doing the usual hunt on yelp we decided to try out spago and it was a great suggestionwhen we arrived the waiter asked if we wanted sit inside or out and we opted to go outside  best choice to be honest i thought the blue ceiling was tacky at first but after a while it really started to trick you that you were outsidethe food was awesome as expected but the service from the waiters was top notch as well highly recommend
R3ngyO7FJWTgNchl4iyKeQ 5 our last night in vegas and we wanted to make sure to finish off with a great meal and bouchon deliverednot only were the meals great but the dessert we had was sooo good as well highly recommend this place for anyone looking for something a bit different and a great atmosphere
ng7SL-rFmvJnPbH2-OPaaw 5 never being to a cirque du soleil before i didnt know fully what to expect but judging by what everyone else had told me it would be an amazing showhappy to say it was superb and ill be certain to see another if i get the chance it was amazing to see the skills of the performers and it was a great mix of acrobatics theatre and comedylooking forward to the next one
WVckAkG4n5WM0S5rngVY-w 3 we always love our italian food so i couldnt resist checking out this place when we were inside wynn checking out the casinoit was a great find and the decor inside was executed perfectly the staff we really quick to serve us and the meals came out really quick we had asked for a white sauce instead of the tomato for one of our meals which they got wrong but were very apologetic and came out just as quick with another one for usall up a great meal and find in such a great casino
W5Y3_9iKXLo-iSiqXFfnCw 3 worth it just for the viewwe only went up to visit the lounge one big downside was the cover charge 20 each that we werent expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck the drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there but the main thing we went for the view was well worth it  especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below
GgyrFtdqdVHdvqk7g95JZw 3 we had been recommended pink jeep from some friends of ours and were really thankful they didthe trip was well organised with them picking us up from the hotel and then heading out to the canyon our driver gave us some great commentary on the way out and had the perfect balance of not talking the whole time but still being really informativewe stopped at a few spots on the way out including hoover dam and a small store for a rest stop which made the trip out there feel even more authentic going into an actual country storewe didnt realise when we got there that we would all be going onto buses afterwards but the guide was really good at making sure we all had the freedom of looking around each lookout and then still grouping back together at the endthanks for making it an easy and great trip
TCem-xp4QstqyCZcfRKfCA 5 this place is a must visit for anyone to las vegasim so thankful i came across it on here as it was never suggested to us by anyone else or even at the hotel we were staying you start off the tour at their meeting spot where they give you plenty of water and warnings about just how hot it can get in there so be carefulwe got to meet our tour guide as well who gave us a quick background on the nonprofit organisation behind the museum  its great to see such a dedicated group of people preserving what some people would just treat as junkits an amazing collection of old signage and as part of the tour around the boneyard the guide gave us some great and humorous history about las vegas this really made the tour as there was so much we learnt at the same time and it was astonishing to learn just how much the city has changedif you like your photography this place is an absolute must visit theres so many good opportunities as the place is full of so much colour and typographystop reading my review and book in now 
Wg4SyEFbAf-rcvOr5s86LA 5 roast beef was amazing that sandwich alone will bring me back again before i leave vegas  i didnt care for the pizza ive had better  but that sandwich was easily one of the best ive had  i ordered a pizza chips and drink and the roast beef sandwich for about 20the veggie sandwich is around 8 is also great and the blt is good as well
VluIpojME0yKOcRKI5L0Iw 3 came here on monday no line its good but not to go out of your way good  price is reasonable it is hard to find but that was the fun of it trying to find it  no name no sign  if your clubbing  the cosmo and your have the munchies this is your place  they use fresh toppings crust is thin and very tasty
oAzCMKU2H_zuhGuODUryfw 3 its ok if it fits your budget plus when you get out your on freemont  but if you are not a silly person or dont have enough drinks in you it will be hard to get into buy your tickets at tix4tonight on the strip it comes out to 104 for two dont get the pasta most didnt finish theres  chicken was ok   sodas are free and well drinks are 6
MCkijUA1sGibn-zupKyJvQ 5 for the price the rooms are huge and very comfortable the ac was strong for 110 degree heat the beds were comfy and they have a hid abed large bathrooms separate tub and shower this place is a hotel first and casino second all the rooms are in different buildings from the casino which makes it very family friendly        front desk was very friendly and helpful even though its not on the strip its a block and half away from the center of the strip a short cab ride or a short walk and you can be at ceasers palace bellagio parisand ballys for the shuttle to the rio wifi is free in the lobby and pool side there is a fee to have it in your room there is a resort fee if you book it through a third party like orbitz travelocity pricelineetc you should check there price first and see if you can save some money i was there from thursday to monday on labor day weekend it was quite and peace full as appose to the chaos of the strip on a holiday weekend
iK_19xLKRTZtL4L4ssj-Aw 3 again great deal for the price and location plus free breakfast  50 on saturday  king room flat tvkureg coffee good water pressure did not hear the people next door and hope they didnt hear us unlike planet hollywood where you hear everything
cyOVXbImAMR10YwBjJ8Izw 3 cant go wrong here in the mood for sandwich this is it its baked and toasty healthy and filling its not as good as jersey mikes but almost there  price is very worth it
YgIvr5Za2RaTIZShxyoA8Q 5 ok ok this is the best buffet in vegas period  there is a lot of variety the desserts are very good  the lamb shoulder cooked to perfection  but what does it is free all you can drink beer and wine  im talkin about the regular buffet on wednesday under 55 for two  without a players club we got to the line around 7 and were seated about 715 it wasnt to busyat the dessert bar you can order fresh coffee or a latte with kahlua if somebody hadnt told us we wouldnt have known       everything was really good the place is very clean  dont bother looking for the bathroom its not in the buffet its outside to the right
XxsMdJl8OTgeq5iEhp4JLQ 5 this is for the fireside loungegreat place to finish the night off or start it  the appetizers were large portions and the well drinks were also great  it has a old las vegas feel to it
fxyFE8BiwfIeGfIgi0I4qA 3 mystery adventure is must do sunday thru thursday its great but its 3hrs long i like the fact that it had something for everybody you dont have to be a mystery junkie to enjoy the adventure and for the price you really cant beat it nothing in vegas will keep you entertain for so long for so little plus theres snacks to munch on while you try to look for clues the one thing that is definitely fun is to determine what clues you need to solve the mystery and what clues you dont   youll get to meet people and work as a team to solve the mystery  if your on a tight budget this is a must
qhTMlDmQqZI02EuTQPlGdQ 5 besides going up the eiffel tower and the crepes its the only reason i even step inside the paris casino  ive been here several times already and it hasnt gotten old  no cover two drink minimum and  pricey to if you havent you must  two guys on a piano going at it  they play everything from oldies to todays music
P1OMjonI7MOGn0KqHGQC-A 3 i was there from june 24 to 27th the room big enough for four adults we checked in early and we got a room on the 25th floor facing the strip that was the best part the view was unbelievable the ac was strong the room was very modern and clean the beds were very comfortable the casino i didnt care to much about nothing special to see or write about there is a free show outside the hotel if you havent seen it its worth check out the area is pretty good there is tram to the mirage and next to that is ceasers palace and on the other side is a big mall accross the street is the venetian harras casino and a shuttle to rio that were the best buffet in vagasand the carnival bar pool parties are not the worst but not the best either the dj was pretty good the down side very little shade there is a mandatory 22 a day resort fee that includes wifi in every room and newspaper in the lobby they dont tell you about the fee until you check in
raK0ehaHg0iZvdNP8EnuBg 3 great tip i found by accident book your room through wwweasyclicktravelcom and you wont pay a resort fee of 20 per night  im not sure if it works for other hotels as well  the hotel is great location great bathtub comfy bed good or great view of the strip depending on your room  only downside is walls are thin you can hear the next room so gotta keep the tv turned up
IEMR_Vo-0g53fPjqlaxeSA 5 it doesnt get better than green valley ranch sportsbook  1 dollar beer 1 dollar hot dogs turf grill only top of the line food and priced very good plus free well drinks when you gamble must get coupon when you place wager  get there early and you get your own tv booth the waitresses are very thorough they walk down every isle and ask everybody if the want a drink unlike ceasers  the whole right side is for football and the left is for horse racing  but you can pretty much sit anywhere
FvjiRz5AhudQ34C6P8YLgQ 5 pros  our window was from floor to cielling and wall to wall with a view of the striphuge rooms huge bedfridge in closet safelots of mirriorsshuttle to the striponly seafood buffet in vegas that i know ofthe ac is strongcons resort fee unless you book with easyclicktravelcom then you dont pay resort feecarnival buffet could be betterpool needs more shade
p3A56Xd6L7JM3URwL2_91A 1 this place is a coffee shop by day and a bar by night which may help explain the stripper pole and the dance floor really nice atmosphere loungelike seating areas and free wifi whats not to like  well while i did appreciate not being charged for soy milk and i liked that they charged extra for to gopaper cups i think it was 50 cents the soy latte i had was totally awful bitter sour and composed of mostly foam maybe this was an off day but it was honestly atrocious i wouldnt mind visiting blondies in the evening sometime but i think ill just skip the coffee from now on
lnU-YB13acJD5b3Hos9bYw 5 relaxing atmosphere educational chalk based corn diagrams and air conditioning what more could you ask for well add to all of that that the food is delicious maizal is a recent addition to the liberty village area they have vegan and glutenfree options in addition to nonveganveg onesthe menu is short and simple at the moment the vegan options are grilled quesadillas sin queso ask for no cheesedairy with either poblano peppers or mushrooms the sopes with black beans tlacoyos bean filled tortillas and opales cactus all very yummy sounding options their tortillas are entirely corn based and glutenfree and made fresh every morning they also happen to be deliciousother things on the menu i should mention the horchata traditionally milkless its rice based at maizal with a cinnamon spice and perfectly ice cold outdoor patio space is out front on jefferson and small but decent interior space is ample but i imagine its going to be an area lunch time takeout place pleaser a tasty healthy meal for under ten dollars if you sit in like we did you can read about the history and cultivation of corn on the very aesthetically pleasing chalkboards and no joke it really is interesting and let me say it again air conditioningwe each ordered 2 grilled quesadillas sinqueso no cheese we sat sipping on horchatas while we waited and enjoyed the corn diagrams they arrived with pico de gallo on shredded lettuce and a side of refried beans  one poblano pepper and one mushroom one bite and ive decided these tortillas are made of tasty magic that one bite was all tortilla and it was so rich in maizeyflavour and texturally superior to nearly all other tortillas ive had up until now so i eat a lot of tacosthe fillings for both were great both hearty and satisfying with rich savory flavours add some of the pico and a touch of lettuce and it is perfection the folks at maizal are doing exciting things with food and im looking forward to seeing more and eating much more from themps prices are reasonable
ZWGcxdt0-60YpvS7L57qiA 3 this is another place id never have stumbled upon had it not been for the indie coffee passport im never in the george brown area we dropped in on a saturday morning and it was mostly empty  walking by it looks like an old antique furniture store with a random assortment of unmatched piecesno but really i like random and i like the atmosphere its weird but well lit ill call it cozy i liked the big wooden table by the window i didnt have any luck connecting to their wifi with my ipod but i saw other people on laptops tapping away minimal plug ins but they existit was a beautiful looking cup of coffee but it may have also been the worst almond latte ive ever drank i think its great that they offer almond milk but im not convinced they knew how to use it that day overall my problem was that the coffee was very bitter way too bitter although it didnt effect me this place is cash only no debit cards allowed
8ZMhRRoj3TEq32TQkGfgIA 1 i went to zteca for the first time a few weeks ago after being really excited to try it out unfortunately as with most over hyped oversold places once i did try it i was really disappointedservice was friendly but the flavour was lacking it felt like i had gone to chipotle but so much worse the rice and vegetables were boring and rice was in copious amounts beans are optionalextra what is up with that its a burritoi doused my burrito in hot sauce to give it some flavour and vowed to find some where else to go next time i was hungry in fairview mall
xyNUC_p5KPI8LOCrAXZHnw 5 so its the first day toris bakeshop is open so maybe its premature to review them but i cant help it yelp must know about a new vegan  gluten free friendly bakeryit took me about 40 minutes on the queen streetcar  to get here after work but it was worth it since it was the end of the day they had already run out of many of their sweet baked treats even after apparently baking 3 days worth of things but i grabbed a vanilla cupcake with butter cream frosting a delicious chocolate chip cookie and a gluten free butter tart and a non gluten free butter tart they were all delicious the cupcake was spongy and fluffy the icing sweet whipped and not stiff at all i was especially partial to the gf butter tartfriendly service and great interior design i loved the overhead lights  theyre freaking lamps made from giant beaters plus every table had fresh flowers on it one word sums this place up   adorable in two words  adorably delicious i love the random jars with stuff in it aesthetic lots of greens and neutral tonesalso  wififree functional wifi there are outlets all over the place if you look for them one main one that i know of is right at the front corner with the comfy seating yesgolly i wish this was closer to parkdaletrinitybellwoods  though odds are ill be back really really soon
J0WxHbfHRJRwR8v5eZSv5A 1 im not quite sure what the fuss is about about chipotle my burrito was flavourless and unexciting when i bit into it i couldnt help but think wow i waited 15 minutes in line for this i think it didnt help that one of the members of counter staff left right as i got to her station so i stood there an extra 5 or 6 minutes waiting for someone further down the chain to realize oh nothing is happeningthe one of the things i did like was the tortilla chips with the hint of lime and the fresh picomaybe i had a bad experience maybe ive just had really amazing mexican food maybe i should try them again or maybe i should just try a different location
5TU970wx8_zGCWH6cAl6dw 3 im late to the hot beans praising party but not late in trying out their delicious tacos and donuts taking a bite out of one of their fresh lime coconut donuts makes me want to write poetry but it looks like another reviewer has taken care of thatso what can i say i havent eaten anything here i didnt like the tacos are all delicious though my favourite is the yuba and an order of nachos is filling and flavourful with spiced beans cashew cream cheese some kind of cheese sauce and veggies ive been eyeing those burritos but havent gotten around to ordering one yetim happy to see a couple of different hot sauces on the side bench along with a help yourself collection of water jugs you might notice the lack of garbage can well everything is biodegradable which is awesome but i cant help but be compelled to bring along a reusable container with me so i dont waste any more paper bags on donuts i inhale in 5 minutes anywaythe limeade can be a bit too heavy on the agave sometimes but otherwise i have no serious complaints service depends on the day and whos at the counter but its usually somewhere between decent and awesomethe seating is limited to about 912 people depending on where youre sitting but it hasnt felt crowded any of the several several several times ive gone in there is a lot of foot traffic people running in and out to grab a quick bite the simplicity of their menu and pricing scheme is appreciated just enough choice without too much choice what you see on the board is what you will pay tax is included and combining donuts and tacos or beverages results in a nice round number which nutty folks like me will appreciatei havent checked them out for breakfast on the weekends but its definitely on my to do list breakfast burritos tempting temptingseriously vegan or otherwise at the very least pick up a donut you wont regret it really go eat
LmB8A15Vah5-SDchzKzJlw 3 ive lived in toronto for two whole years as of this month and i have never once had  a bad time there more often than not weve gone there for brunch and the service has been stellar not just hey theyll bring me my order the way i asked for it but theyll do that and be friendly helpful and fast service is great they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating without attitudea big one for me is they are vegan friendly including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town with most brunch items available veganized and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lactoovovegetarian friendly too you sit where you want you can play board games if you want you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu yes they have one or just check out whats on offer to drink on the chalkboardill also say that the food is okay tofu scramble is hit or miss but usually its decent enough that even on its worse ive had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians so there is thative gone with friends ive gone with family ive gone in pairs ive gone in big groups go for brunch its great go for drinks its fun other stuff cash only but there is an atm inside they have baked goods and cheesecake from through being cool vegan bakery and conveniently close to nazareth ethiopian restaurant eat delicious ethiopian food then go drinking
lQkK4Gc3OBjunuacm8kH-w 3 i finally went to burritos boyz the other day and i was really pleased with what i got flavourwise and servicewise it trumps chipotle entirelyi got a vegan burrito and didnt feel deprived of anything it was a nice big meal i really liked how they constructed it it made a huge difference when biting in there was an intermingling of flavours rather then the usual oh heres rice oh heres lettuce oh heres salsa  feeling i get from some other places it was quite filling though i probably could have eaten two for lunch i think grilling the burrito is a nice touch crispy on the outside warm and yummy on the inside they have veggie ground round and vegan guacamole and hot sauce thats actually hot i wish they also had some daiya because that would have made this place all around perfectwe got there right before the lunchtime rush so not only did we get our orders quickly i even snagged a seat in the corner
97d7Qy70tyFoJJaGVuCaqg 3 there are a few vegan options here and they are labelled clearly on the chalkboard near the cashier though they dont always write everything theyre serving on the board service was friendly and quick i ordered the sweet potato and rapini pie which wasnt as tasty as the dish my friends ordered the cauliflower and soy protein pie they have a vegan cheesecake that is phenomenalits a cozy little space and there were a few other folks there when we walked in on saturday but it didnt feel too crowdedill have to try their coffee next time
ZN6_sQ0lyfmkh80x3Pl0eA 3 i went here last week on friday and it was great i wondered why it had taken me so long to actually go in well i know why the outside doesnt look nearly as inviting as the inside does menu is colour coded and vegan vegetarian glutenfree or nonveg friendly there is probably something for everyone here which makes it a good potential spot to take nonveg inlaws or something service was great our server seemed to actually like it there and was knowledgeable about the menui had the phish and chips and would totally eat them again pretty delicious crispy deepfried pieces of tender tofu with a side of chips and spicy house made tartar saucei think its time to check them out for a sunday brunch and see what it looks like on a busy day
0xHhGITMc-kyCJLn2t5trw 3 i prefer this location to the other ones in the city we live really close to the queen west one but order delivery or dinein at this onedine in service is always friendly and quick dishes are veganizable there are lots of options the food is always tasty and the portions are huge were eaters but we still end up taking food home with us the food could be spicier but that seems pretty standard in this city and nothing a bit of hot sauce cant fixmy delivery experiences have varied when i order things through orderit or just eat  the resulting delivery takes forever there are often issues with our order like egg in the pad thai when we specifically said veganno egg and the prices are more expensive than just ordering directly so we started calling them to place delivery orders and things went much more smoothly orders seemed to come faster with no mistakes
slfzD2yLMjVYXjPdVumtug 3 i went to check out kupfert  kim today at first canadian place it was reasonably busy even at 3pmservice was friendly  though it seems like they have a lot of staff behind a very small counter maybe it was shift change its a very clean looking space and i like the selection of vegan and glutenfree sweet treats like stuff from earth  city bunners bake shop and rawlly deliciousi ordered the first canadian  and while ive often felt really bored with bowls of vegetablesgrainsetc this one was a great mix of ingredients  tempeh quinoa  shredded red and green cabbage sweet potato and a flavourful dressing on the sidetheyve got a decent selection of milks soy almond coconut and  rice for prepared coffee drinks like cappuccino lattes etc  and fresh juicesopen from 8am to 5pm theyve got breakfast and lunch menus and seem like a great option for meatless wheatless fare in the financial districtthey just opened two weeks ago so they still seem to be working out all the kinks and they dont have a useful website yet but as far as the food is concerned  so far so good
Qwu0ke4_G4OtemDnQKeYZQ 3 love this place sure it was way out of town for me sure i cant figure out a way to get there with public transit from toronto but its worth the trip however you get thereto be honest before we went there i thought it was just going to be danishes which was actually exciting in and of itself but it had a variety of other danish baked goods like marzipan cookies and kransekake  as well as vegan chocolate bars chocolate soft serve cookies brownies and biscotti and little grocery type items like fake tuna and nondairy cheesethe woman that runs the bakery is so sweet and friendly i felt like i could talk to her all day about food and not get tired of it another great part about this place is that its inside of a costume shop cant go wrong with that
myPaYLCqKBNe4xc-Wt30hw 3 i neglected to read the reviews on here regarding the greyhoundtoronto coach lines line and stood in line at 5am i might add 5am does not make me a happy camper for 15 minutes while a woman argued with the counter guy about something ridiculous i dont envy these people their jobs i cant imagine the crap they have to deal withso i came to the counter talking about greyhound he told me and its probably been the millionth1 time hes said this to go to the greyhound counter down in the waiting room and talk to the guy in the vest well shucks who knew the waiting room was clean my ticket situation was sorted out without any issue well before my bus arrived so i really dont have any complaintsi really hate going through airport security and for certain trips like nyc for example the rates on the greyhound are really reasonable especially with advanced purchase i usually dont have to sit with anyone and most importantly is she joking i can get wifi the entire way down
OEGEWMmywVHgVR3TuZYZ6A 3 id like to say i loved this place because for the most part i didthe veggie selection was beautiful the store was bright and clean but ultimately all of that was ruined by my experience at the check outi went through the self check out you know so i could avoid talking to cashiers and go through the process quickly instead the attendant would not leave me alone and it took twice as longhe hovered and hassled me the entire time i was going through the check out he yelled out the veggies at me that i was buying from his station and it was really frustrating it totally ruined the whole experience for me if i do go back im not going to bother doing self checkout and i dont recommend anyone else does either not much point if someone is going to micromanage the entire processi would have given this place a five i wanted to give this place a two after i left but it gets a begrudging three because it has such a nice selection and a clean bright location
drex7uO1HzcbS4iG6HZLBA 5 first of all this is probably the best vegetarian restaurant ive been to in the toronto area and probably in my top ten of vegetarian restaurants ive been to in north americai took a big burly omnivore with me and he loved everything we ordered so i take that as a great signwe started things off with an order of crispy oyster mushrooms and seared dumplings i wish we had ordered two orders of the crispy oyster mushrooms because i can never have enough they are so rich and flavourful and the sweet slightly spiced sauce is a perfect compliment for itwe both ordered the special of the day which was a tofu skin wrapped taro root mash on a bed of greens with a side of noodles and a flavour explosion of a mango salad our waitress totally sold it her description got my mouth watering from the very beginning it adds so much to a meal when the server is friendly and she was wonderful moreover she clearly loved the place and the food which is exactly the type of person i want advising me on what to orderi was feeling pretty full after finishing my plate but there is always room for dessert my dining companion and i shared a piece of chocolate cake and a brownie sundae but since they were out of brownie they used lightly warmed chocolate cookies  what can i say other than delicious delicious delicious the chocolate cake was good but not as good as the sundae though im glad our server made sure we took the left over chocolate cake home because while it wasnt as awesome when it went head to head with the sundae it was fantastic by itself at 3amin short  order the crispy mushrooms you wont be disappointed  and the special its consistently amazing
dZ_a6D96J3Of26svfe8Cng 5 ive been travelling a lot lately and in the time i was away having fun and eating lots of great food bloomers opened and i was really looking forward to coming home and visiting this still new vegan cafe and bakery in bloorcourtso finallyi got to visit them today first impressions are i love the wide open space that there are multiple options for seating booths tables high tables etc theyve got free wifi i didnt look for power outlets this time service was really nice and friendly and i felt pretty comfortable just hanging out with my coffee for a bittoday i saw a couple of different kinds of donuts fluffy coconut donut holes chocolate chip cookies butter tarts blueberry tarts bagels and a donut bread pudding and probably more but i was especially drawn to the bagels as i havent seen bagels around any of the fine vegan bakeries we have in our city and i happen to really like bagels and usually end up making them myself as an added bonus they had tofutti cream cheese available theyve got a variety of kombuchas teas blue sky soda and assorted bottled fruit juices in addition to fancy and more regular coffee options i hear there is a menu extension coming in september with sandwiches and the like coming soon so im pretty excited to check that out too when it appearsi liked it here i would and will be back again soon accessibilitywise today the door was wide open otherwise its not powered but there is a bit of a quarter step to get in and  in a wonderful departure from the usual toronto bathroom in the basement style the restroom is on the main floorand regarding one of the other reviews it seems a little no it seems a lot ridiculous to complain about the lack of dairy products at a vegan cafe
wXbXiBW2bY65Bvf-KRK-LA 3 i come here about once every two weeks mostly out of convenience since its near my workplace has vegan options and offers a decent alternative to subwaysushipizza options i have in the areaservice is always friendly and helpful reasonably quick and they dont use a microwave to heat up your samosas  which some other indian restaurants do in the area ew ive had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said the curries are quite bland  they are spiced but not really especially if youve gotten used to more authentic little india flavours and just generally have a healthy flavor to them its not terrible but missable id recommend the vegetable samosas instead or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice they do bake them  so they arent deliciously deep fried but still the filling is nicetheyve recently upped the price of the samosas but 3 samosas and two chutneys will still only run you just under 5
5FEDLEk1iWRBljSlfdNeRQ 3 i like this place  i need to go back on a friday or saturday night to see what its really like but i went a couple hours before closing on a wednesday with nicole h and it was pretty comfortable with four tables occupiedi like the interior it seems like a place i would actually go to just drink coffee or do some work with the added benefit of having games available if i wanted to play themthey have a great selection of games in the back and various events happen every week including a scrabble meetup group scrabble in the city every thursday nightbeer and other alcohol selection appears ample but since it was 3 pm on a wednesday i opted for tea prices for food and drinks are very reasonable as of yet there is no game playing feeas an extra bonus service is friendly but also unintrusiveno onmenu vegan food options or treats yet but they do make veg sandwiches with hummus which is something
tlyTYvacw8ZAXiLLlx7bAg 3 i thought i was finished with fresh but a friend from out of town came to visit and wanted to come here for brunch so okay back to freshit still didnt win me over  but this visit was better than beforeour server was a bit weird but ultimately helpful and friendly so thats all that matters one of the other servers helping the table next to us was terrible and im glad we didnt have her she seemed to be all attitude and no helpbrunch was great i got the pancake platter which comes with two pancakes of your choice two vegan breakfast sausages and tofu scramble for 12 i could have done without the overspiced boring tofu scramble but the pancakes banananut flavoured were excellent especially when slathered with margarine and dark rich maple syrup tofu sausage was fantastici got an americano  and while it wasnt a very big cup of coffee or very caffeinated it was very tastyi also ordered a side of soy yogurt but really i wouldnt recommend it unless you get some jam its not flavoured with anything so when you order soy yogurt thats really all it is and its not very good next time since there will probably always be a next time with this place bbq burger how can i go wrong with a veggie burger that also includes a couple of those delicious quinoa onion rings
2opOL-2onXpeXxZZpTddPg 3 we went to bello bio earlier this month to check out their selection of products all the food items there are vegan and imported from italy the imported part sounded a little strange since ive never thought of italy as a very veg friendly place but we learned from the owner that italy has a growing veganvegetarian populationgreat selection of random products they have grain based pseudomeats and a very interesting mozzarisella sprouted rice based soft dairy free cheese which made an excellent addition to a recent caprese salad they have prepared foods and frozen items available to take home such as varieties of vegan stuffed raviolithose folks are friendly and the products have a lot to offer flavourwise and i liked that they have products that are veganplantbased without depending entirely on soyim looking forward to going back and picking up more stuff soon
c809aHZog6sooFr2_gw3ew 1 we ordered delivery from this location and it was okay but not amazing i think their queen street location is better or maybe we hit them on the wrong day the fredo pizza is normally covered with thinly sliced potato and a nice level of rosemary and other spices this time around it was rather sparse considering they said an hour for delivery and we were only 6 minutes away if you walk i would have expected theyd have enough time to actually cook the potatoes properly i wish we had just picked it up maybe it would have been better they have three vegan pizzas on the menu and an extensive combination of other types as well so id start the pizziolo experience at a different location if you want something especially good that said my slightly undercooked potato pizza was still better flavourwise than the pizza pizza in the neighbourhood
rcw7dhLyknJ9fOetaT_p7w 1 easy wasnt easy i considered getting a smoothie and word on the street is their coffee is stellar but it was busy and after about 1015 minutes with no coffee we left before ordering
5earr_XVTtD6FiP1ph8qzw 5 ive watch dbeatstro improved their offerings and options over the last few months and its been great to see them grow from sort of disorganized but charming to really having a solid menu kitchen and coffee set up they have a nice variety of baked goods occasionally have glutenfree options too for those of you that needwant them and herbalist blended teas available but my favourite thing now is their brunch because its good really goodseating is comfortable and well spaced out so if youre tired of sharing elbow room with other folks during weekend brunches  this might be a great spot to check out the restaurant and cafe is also wheelchair andor mobility device accessible with a ramp outside they also have an accessible washroomthe folks here make a great soy latte and why anyone would recommend going to a starbucks or tim hortons over even a nondairy latte i dont understand but kevin s you do you they also have a variety of other fun drinks  like hot chocolate white hot chocolate matcha lattes and other surprises in store for you  they also only have soy almond coconut and cashew oh no too many options branch out a littlecheck em out for brunch or during the week
jcDEi86UzPtvyo-5X_y6aw 5 you know those times when you visit a cafe or store and leave with the desire to tell everyone you meet how wonderful it is thats how i feel about this placethey have a great warm inviting atmosphere and its a cozy ie kind of a small space while there is room for about three people to sit in the window area prepare to either stand and eat or take a box home or eat there and take a box of treats home like i didthe people working there are friendly and helpful and when i walked in all wideeyed and overwhelmed with options they gave me a run down of what they had and offered some recommendations bunners was just all around fantastic from the start and then i ate one of the gypsy cookies and i was completely sold oats melty chocolate chips dried cranberries and a few other things combined into a soft chewy cookie i want to go back right now and get another onei should probably mention that in my experience gluten free tends to secretly mean gross and i have been known to occasionally thank my body for not having celiac disease so what im saying when i say this place is good is that its not just glutenfree good its actually goodwhen i went in today there were cupcakes three different kinds vanilla chocolate and red velvet donuts amazingly yummy cookies gypsy cookie freshly baked loaves of bread which im kicking myself for not trying muffins and cookie sandwicheswhat im going to hope for is that every coffee shop in town starts using them as their source for vegan andor gluten free treats while they have decent enough coffee and silk soy creamer is available i sure wouldnt mind having one of their cookies or muffins with a nice soy latte of course crema coffee is just across the street
pvqpAzPNNIbb4ng24HRSFA 5 balluchon is now i deal coffee its basically the same place but betteri love this place now so my regular monday sorauren farmers market visit is paired with a tasty cup of coffee from i deal coffee as wellservice has been fantastic every time ive gone in it feels like a space thats good to hang out in they have vegan andor glutenfree options and have soy and almond milk at no extra charge yeyso lovely i cant wait to keep going backas an added bonus since they only recently took over that location they are part of the indie coffee passport lessthan3 edition so you can give them a try while taking advantage of a really great dealtheyre currently cash only but it sounded like they were planning on getting a debit machine at some point
i-h0c7yy4Qla0YsInKqg5A 5 you might have seen this vegan bakery win the toronto vegetarian associations vegan bake off repeatedly and youve might have seen it at the vegetarian food festival or at the farmers market or a bunch of other places around the city and ontarionow youll see it in a sweet location in the annexfull disclosure ive been excited about this bakery opening for months and i dont care who knows it i have wanted a source for a steady supply of vegan magic squares and now i have one ps get the magic squaresi had the opportunity to visit the bakery during the sneakpeak opening in december and bought magic squares but not enough a cookie and a couple of candied apples and it felt like early xmasthen i waited impatiently for their opening this month and today i braved the snow and went in i left with dark chocolate croissants magic squares obviously and a pot pie my partner came home with croissants a couple of sausage rolls and a whoopie pie yes were getting ready to hibernate this weekendthe croissants are ridiculously flaky the magic squares are incredible as usual i havent eaten anything else yet but ive sort of come to expect that anything from apiecalypse now will be really goodin the fridge  freezer so far theyve got all of these things are vegan cashew ricotta caesar salad dressing flavoured butters lasagna pot pies shepherd pie gluten free and glutenfull chili mac potato salad tzatziki tartar sauce northwood cold brew coffee which im drinking right now  tasty and morei like that there appears to be a sincere effort made to find ethical ecologically sound and human friendly products to make  bake stuff and that they have compostable packagingservice was friendly and fast  they take cash credit and debitthere is no seating inside so prepare to take outps try the magic squares
WLXHkQSKTQoGa18auekSPw 3 this place is huge but lacks seating i spent a considerable amount of time visualizing how they could fit more tables in without getting to crowded and i can see why they set it up the way they did but a couple more tables wouldnt hurt but thats what everyone saysi love the space floor to ceiling windows facing queen st and the rest is brick high ceilings ample bookshelves and the random old stove in the center it just worksi ordered a soy latte and it was delicious not too bitter not too boring foam was nice and thick but not too much just right unfortunately they dont seem to have any to stay cups but on the plus side theyve got free wifi and they dont charge extra for soy milkone thing i find really cool about ground level is that it operates as part of ground level youth ventures where youth learn life skills and job training beyond just making coffee definitely something im into supportingi went here solely because it was part of the indie coffee passport but ill go there again if im in the neighbourhood my latte was better than the cups ive gotten from other shops in the area
0ZdxpYp6_SMsJ4ZU7Y-hJA 3 feel good guru is in the progress of slowly opening  its a takeout place right across the street from trinitybellwoods park and conveniently located in my neighbourhood i walked in not caring what i ordered i wanted to try anything i ordered the soup which was a hearty miso based vegetable lentil with lots of greens and packed with flavour perfect for todays rainy glumnessthe space is really clean and relaxing there is seating for about 4 people but like i said its styled as a takeout place so you know you could hypothetically take stuff out and eat in the park there are fresh herbs in a wallmounted garden that look absolutely lovely they also have a useful website that actually gives you the information ive come to expect raw cakes to be delicious and feel good gurus cake was no exception in fact it was even better than i expected it to be and the raw bar is raised pretty high already  she gave me a sample for free and i want more of that chocolate heaven in my mouth luckily they are right down the street so i could wander over any time i want lucky me
csA_guqbDHdTHVqH3J9KAA 1 meh id feel okay just leaving the review at that this place embodies meh ive had better i walk by every day on the way to work so i thought maybe this will be my alternative to starbucks or on days when i feel like being treated rudely tim hortons nope  the coffee tasted burnt in a bad way and soy milk is 070 cents extra i hate thati was oversold on the 20 gift card i like going out for coffee because its relaxing  i didnt expect to have to say no not interested to some pseudo promotion gift card  meh repeatedlywith the exception of the sales pitch  service in general was quite friendly though but not friendly enough that i would go back again
QBtZUwzwWdR7iESmgwJZaA 3 this location was my first foray into the pizzaiolo chain since moving to torontowe went to this location at 3am on a saturday night and asked for half a fredo with potatoes rosemary and oregano  and half a vittoria tomatos zucchini red peppers they didnt even blink no problem done when we got it it was packed with toppings hot and delicious everything seemed cooked to perfection afterwards service was a bit off i tried to buy a drink and stood at the counter drink in hand while the server talked on the phone for about five minutes then i put the drink back in the fridge and sat down to finish my pizza on the plus side the variety of pizza they offer is nice they have vegan and vegetarian pizza available by the slice amongst others and they are open super late
hVjdPSU7sPDXR6vsWgOU-g 3 its a starbucks with the same problems and benefits that every starbucks has the coffee is the same as every other starbucks and they never seem to use separate containers for soy and dairy frappuccinos but they are quick there is lots of seating and a good collection of power outlets at this location you just have to find themoverall its always clean some of the staff are reasonably friendly
DXsd-_QA4wmgA8IZ36EgXg 3 no more trudging downtown to get a oily slice of potato rosemary the fredo pizza for me finally a new pizzaiolo up north and in my neighbourhoodthis location is clean and at 4pm completely empty except for the reasonably friendly dudes working there they had a special deal going on for a free beverage with purchase for their grand opening which is now over but honored my request anyway free soda is always a plus pizza was decent one half of the giant slice was perfect the other half was more than half of my daily requirement of olive oil crispy tasty crust maybe verging on too crispy but it was still within tolerance levels also im happy that they actually had a vegan pizza available which is more than i can say for half of the downtown locations ive been to after 7pm id come here again and i hope business picks up because that area has been lacking in quick tasty vegan or otherwise food options
TWz4-EKzizpfzFxUYai44A 5 ive been going to totum for almost a year now i think and its been great for seriously getting into weight lifting without having to navigate through clusters of bros and other gym jerks everyone is generally nice respectful of space and you know no one is ever doing bicep curls in the squat racki still havent convinced myself to go on a repeat visit to any of the 6am classes but they exist for those prework workout fiends im just too much of a night owl im also lazyclasses to chose from include yoga classes pilates boxing kettle bell workouts spinning crossfit and a whole bunch of others lots of elliptical machines 56 treadmills and bikes they also have a decent variety of weight machines free weights and other equipment to play withthere is one personal trainer that without fail will change the music station from some amazing technodubremix you know perfect workout music to some weird classic rockeasy listeningcrud so word of advice  bring some headphones if youre going in the middle of the day the weekend hours are not as convenient they close at 6ish but i do like that theyre open later than most gyms on fridaysone other thing i like is that they have other sport related services available on site in addition to personal trainers there are chiropractors rmts a holistic nutritionist and an nd its nice to have the option of just going in working out seeing an rmt or someone else and going homeits clean friendly and welcoming there is a free week trial and id totally recommend you try it out but only if youre awesomeworstbest thing  its right next to soma chocolate
0JMRNpqIu1emDdydUmzXAw 3 i went to nazareth yesterday and we lucked out because it was nearly empty inside however it filled up within 30 minutes of our arrival and then there was a bit of a linethe service was fast and friendly but there was a bit of a wait to get our actual plate but it wasnt uncomfortably long our server checked on us regularly and was very pleasantwe ordered one order of the vegetarian combination plate and between the two of us we still didnt finish all of itover all it was a great experience we got there at just the right time and the bill was ridiculously cheap
qf2E2SdZfBzPey8n4qxW5Q 3 upon walking in i was delighted to see that they brew a very familiar coffee stumptown coffee the coffee found in nearly every coffee shop everywhere in portland oregon aka stumptown the nostalgia was short lived i think i prefer the intelligencia coffee ive had nearly everywhere else in the citymy barista was friendly and helped me out right away so that part was nice they charge extra for soy milk and in doing so became the most expensive latte ive had in toronto however i should also mention the portion is comparatively bigger than other places so im not exactly complaining about that partlit has wifi lots of seating and a nice interior
jU4FaU01qNMLOwlQB8Ta0A 3 i like this place i guess thats why i keep coming back the seats are comfortable i like that i can lean back and the temperature has always been decent unlike some places the location cant be beat easy access from dundas subwayi know some people arent into the butter flavoured topping that amc has going on but i love that its available not that its in anyway good for you mmm soybean oil just that all signs point to its veganness which works for meas with every movie theater they will gouge you at the concession and make you wish you had the foresight to sneak in your own snacks
H6TibVavE0ybsX9mp1zsIA 3 i didnt mean to go to freshii for lunch the other day but events conspired in such a way that i was in the neighbourhood hoping to buy a indie coffee pass from crema coffee  but they were sold out and the line was short because their debit was down and my stomach decided it was time to eatafter looking at the menu board i filled out the custom order form and there were lots of options to choose from s  and handed it to the nice server informing everyone that the debit machine wasnt working right at noon time what terrible timingi got the spinach wrap grilled and filled with veggies with balsamic vinegar and olive oil cant go wrong with that combo it was warm and fast even though there wasnt much reason to nothing to melt nothing needed to be cooked im glad i got it grilled it seemed to help keep the wrap together as i was running down bloorif you dont feel like making up a meal for yourself they also have a huge selection of chef creations at least one of which is vegan  that you can modify further if you feel like it for an extra chargethe other benefit to this location is that crema coffee is right inside so you can get a wrap salad bowl or whatever and get a delicious cup of coffee too and by the way crema has one of the best soy lattes ive had in the city though maybe i should save that for a crema reviewjust a note i can never get the freshii wifi to work with my ipod touch but i can connect to it with my netbook maybe its me but im just going to blame them on this one
2gKy-30ang9kLxVP-6QQLw 5 i love shaunas  the prices are great shauna is really nice and my dog has a good time playing there shauna is very knowledgeable and you can tell that she loves animals if i had even the slightest notion that my dog wasnt being cared for i wouldnt go there its too bad someone had a negative experience but ive been here many times and have always seen the dogs in their care happy i have sent many friends to shaunas and am glad that shes so close by i highly recommend
vFY4ynm9LlfvzTGyCLzYZg 3 ive been going here every other week for a mani pedi for several months now  i like the staff they are professional and friendly i feel comfortable there  i like the massage chairs and the fish tank both help me relax  im a stickler for cleanliness and their tools are always sterile autoclaved and they use liners in their foot baths  the service is very consistant from tech to tech so i dont feel the need to be choosy about who does my nails  they give a lengthier massage than most places but i find the massages lackluster  thats really my only suggestion for improvement better massage technique  my gel polish lasts a full two weeks and so does my pedicure not gel  i really like this place and will continue to treat myself to a trip to dream nails every other week
i54ap1U43zlwQHavj9g6Hw 3 we have visited many many times over the years  i love the salsa  the food is excellent and fresh  i wish they would give out a larger bowl for the salsa since the small cups available are not easy to dip a chip in however this is a small complaint  the only other negative is the ambience which is lacking not the most comfortable chairs  everything ive tried has been excellent  the staff is friendly  love it  we will continue to be regulars
FHJdD6hLQWAgZHPwlPGc5Q 5 i love heidis  i go here often and always receive friendly service and delicious food  my husband and kids love it too  as many before me have said the bread is fantastic we buy loaves when we are there so we can enjoy it at home ive tried the eggplant parm sandwich egg salad veggie grilled veggie and a few others and all have been excellent  im a vegetarian so its nice to have lots of choices here  my husband has had roast beef italian pastrami and other subs and has always been happy  i send friends and family here everyone has been happy  i highly recommend heidis
J2IFDV3oKJpTAXpW5x_PWw 1 i came in to get some boba tea and there was a employee eating behind counter that wasnt professional the cashier seem rude and unhelpful
GhwOhdHTy-HSeRqUiqO1gw 5 yesterday i had my new patient appointment with dr adams immediately upon arriving i was happily greeted by 3 women at a side desk they immediately informed me that the ambulance had just left and dr adams was a few minutes behind this was fine with me there were 4 patients waiting and the office was comfortable and clean they made sure all waiting patients knew of the situation and one by one called them back about 45 minutes later happily to my suprise i was already called back  yolanda took my weight and bp   she was professional and kind she did my initial intake and we had a nice laugh as well dr adams was in the room in about 5 minutes now where do i start dr adams is very professional and thorough she was interested in my home life and even what i was reading in the office we discussed many options of treatment for my 3 reasons of being in the office she gave me immediate referrals and advice that i felt was not only professional but thoughtful in her answers she even called for my bloodwork and labs right there in the office instead of sending me on a goose chase to a random lab she related to me and understood my past with what i felt very comfortable sharing with her i have searched for a doctor in nv for 10 yrs i am so pleased that i actually look forward to going back to see dr k adams you are truly one of a kind dr adams god bless you
LC27nzrJ6jBKDdm9C7l_pQ 1 today my best friend and i went to serenity nails at 1pm they sat us down immediately the entire place stunk of someones lunch they began to fill the pedicure tubs and when we asked for it to be warmer one woman began scooping the water out while on her cell phone and chewing with her mouth open we sat with the running water and nobody to turn it off for 8 minutes until it began to overflow in which we recorded this embarresment of a salon proceeded to put on our shoes and leave the blue pedicure water covered half of the back salon and at one point another man doing a manicure stood up observed the mess all over the flow and sat back down to the manicure lol if i could stand on the corner directing people just a block down to dream nails i would pay them not to step foot in this facility what a joke
KR7aBnvDZZcVztymr89eBQ 1 went for a special occasion and let them know in advance asked for a nice table we were put in a corner in a cold area was so cold my shoulders hurt and feet were like ice when i asked to move they were reluctant even though the place was far from full they did move us however next to a drafty door the waiter comes out overly friendly with phoney smile as others on the staff the truffel soup was like a bowl of salt water  the pasta dish was cheap dumplings with frozen peas and 2 mexican shrimps chopped up so small and yes a lot of salt the salmon  was bland but the mashed cauliflower under it was salty and not cooked all the way the broclii was burned we left half of our meals on our plates and no one asked why the service was horrible we constantly had to ask the bus person to find us the waiter way way overpriced and an added 18 service charge for poor service they never said thanks good bye or come again i read so much good about the farms that i really wanted to go but it is a never again does not deserve a 2nd chance 18000 for 2 and did not eat and 2 beverages also my stomach was very uncomforatable from so much salt  i felt very nausiated
YKAOjFO7NDuDO1grovq-Mw 5 this little coffee shop offers a great spot to meet up have an office gathering or just sit and people watch i felt the coffee was a bit high priced but i enjoyed the atmosphere so it was worth it
2Drc2lEdflD0jRUHF-LTsg 5 this place was amazing it was the last restaurant my husband and i visited during our getaway we were shocked at the quality of food for the price cool atmosphere and lots of quality beers to choose from we had the brisket hog belly beans and the jw potatoes i believe thats what they were called everything was amazing definitely try it out if youre in the area
TSqSiHfqtBigBa6ia59K7w 5 amazing tacos a must try if youre in the area quaint place with great service we visited before a cavs game awesome location

mFPOlzjmRbVWHh4E5SL-Dw 5 i cant say enough good about this place oysters are always fresh and theybring in daily from both coasts go on a monday and youll get the two forone deal thats 2 dozen for 30wowas a seafood lover it has become my favorite haunt for a great mealmy daughter teenager  loves their lobster poutine and i am in lovewith their blue crab claw butter lettuce salade with homemade butter milk dressing
3BbEBQ781rVmOBDNsBrmXA 5 my husband and i hired up n smoke for our wedding reception they had catered my husbands work and before he even proposed he said that we should have up n smoke cater our wedding when that time came so when we were planning i made sure to hire them i personally never tried it but i trusted my husbands tastes buds and i couldnt have been happier that we went with them rich was so fast to respond and to answer my questions he was even willing to work with us around the timing of our ceremony and setting up the buffet so we wouldnt be hearing clinging and clattering while we were saying our vows once everyone was served rich and his crew put all the left overs in tin pans and had everything cleaned up in a blink of an eye all night i was hearing about how good the food was from all our guest and i myself have been loving having the left overs to eat and enjoy for the last few days i almost want to find another event soon to have to order different food from them so i can try out their whole menu if you want great bbq food and have an amazing costumer service experience go with rich and up n smoke
kJh7M7OjcRIKQriUgbEObg 5 my wedding was just at villa tuscana this past weekend i honestly couldnt say a bad thing about these wonderful people i was in a few times from when we booked them in july and they were always so willing to sit down and talk to me about my worries and my questions in the end the hall was decorated even better then i thought they were so willing to help me and i had a lot of last minute minor changes and they were there helping me set up the room the way i wanted it to be  i also love that the base price includes so much most places that i was going to to have chair decorations it was going to be an extra charge to do this centerpiece was going to be an extra charge villa tuscana does have a deluxe package but the base package includes so much that if you cant afford the deluxe items you still can have a wide selection of choices also there are some great things that come with the package the dj is included the cake is included and the photographer is included  i highly recommend taking a look at villa tuscana for any kind of big event that you need plan
cSwPtcCDmQC4ZrHYoqvT-w 5 great customer service they go above and beyond with making you feel comfortable and giving you the hairstyle you ask for andrew did an awesome job on my husband and mariana did an amazing job with my hair carlos the owner is really sweet and makes you feel at home hard to trust anyone especially coming from a different state not knowing where to go definitely will be back
mPvmam5MsplMCm80pGTgCQ 3 i came here with expectations after reading some reviews here i have to say the service was not as bad as i thought it would be it is your average asian resto service distant and quick i got the pho with just the noodles and it was better than pho kim longs they do not give you a lot of mint and sprouts like pho kim long but i am sure if you ask for more they will give you more the large was not that big but it was enough for me they have bigger bowls at pho kim long over all i say its not bad i will come back here just because the pho was great service could be better but hey no one said you have to be happy at work as long as they do their job right you do not have to be my bff
pqM3_nzX0YLhafZpuxKDwg 1 service is bad very slow food is meh i do not recommend this place i dont know how they stay open will not go back there unless there is no other option

eQeP51DR5P2as61W349p7w 1 service is slow dont bother coming here if you want to be fed a couple of people were waiting and no one came to even get our drink order its not a big place so i dont know what the problem was really sad as i was looking forward to eating there
3UkxlpG5PMlbgGtCp7W3PQ 5 i made an appointment in the morning to see leah in the afternoon and she was able to see me right away it was my first time at this salon and she was great she was very good at was she does we talked about what kind of cut i wanted and she listened and made some suggestions i like that she was not overly chatty and she just did what she had to do which was to cut my hair leah did not act like she was my bff and i like that i did not come there to chat but to get a good haircut leah is skilled and knows how to cut coarse asian hair she cut my hair just like the way i wanted it and she was so nice the cut was for 30 which was reasonable and there was no push to sell you any shampoo or hair products which i really like i dont like to be put on the spot after a haircut to buy hair products that i do not needi highly recommend leah to anyone i am so glad to have found a great hairdresser that can cut my hair the way i want it
fZ2QN4W4d-iS97L0cc_mSQ 3 great place great customer service i checked into yelp and got 20 off my tab the sushi was ok i have had better lots of dessert options the food was ok they had oysters for lunch the place is clean and huge i would come back here when i visit again recommend it anytime
8KmvTNOtspezwCjwWOa2Yg 3 so we went here and we had fun we did the 20 for 1 hour and ride all the rides you want they had about 5 to 6 rides for kids and 2 rides for adults its ok it is one of those places that you go once and then thats it he mini carts were fun but i would not do it again i dont know why maybe its the smell of the fumes coming from the carts or maybe it just did not do it for me even our 8 yo was just ok with it i guess it depends on how much you like mini cart rides
CFhTaVjg6i08YpoNxhpPaQ 3 our son loves it here for 7 the whole family can get a great workout the bouncers can benefit on getting some repairs but not too bad they work fun fun place closed for parties on the weekend and open tuefri 9301230 and 25pm call first to check the hours worth the trip if you want to have fun and get a work out dont forget socks for everyone they are mandatory
3aDw9UsthVsihMncIegNcA 3 ivy is great  the place is clean and the techs are courteous  the only draw back is the smell of nail salon i dont know if it is the acetone but it is strong  an exhaust fan or opening a door will help but with the cool air outside it might not a good idea  overall it was not a bad experience
NQbH-t9-6jVkmXf15ORlbA 5 dr lefever is a different type of chiropractor  no cracking no pain or popping but effective adjustment  i highly recommend him if you are looking for a chiropractor he is so nice thorough and effective his new office is located on cheyenne and 215
JPjkNAg0drQoABMCQPoTnQ 1 i booked this hotel in a rush and my bad as i did not read the 18night resort fee basically i paid 66night to stay in this hotel i would not have minded that if the hotel was just honest about it i think that it was very sneaky for them to practice such a thingthe resort is huge its like an apartment complex and since we arrived late at night the grounds were so dark it was tough to find your duplex like room it was nice that we were connected only to another room the grounds were clean and quiet the bed was soft and comfy the ac was cold and loud it had room for 2 people and a kid the furniture was old and the the tv in the living room and bedroom was ancient i did not even try and use it the in room safe actually uses a keylol not codethe room has old stained carpet and the ceilings have beams the bathroom was old and small on our first night we actually had no hot water in our room we showered in lukewarm water i called the front desk to report it and the lady acted like i was bothering her the next day at 830 am thank god we were already awake with our dnd sign on the door we get the maintenance people at our door minimizing our no hot water complain i insisted they check and surprise surprise it was broken i demanded to be moved to another roomthe man on the phone who moved us was probably the only normal person there he was appropriate  and helpful  the rest of the staff in this facility have no customer service skills they just dont carethey also put a 100 hold on your cc when you check in i am waiting for them to remove that on my cc or i will definitely dispute iti would not recommend anyone to stay here except for the soft bed and extra pillows there is nothing here to write home about there are a lot of other places in scottsdale that will appreciate your business and you can get more for your money stay away
JGMi5MkPwL3G1xYDw9vgjw 3 sushi was ok nothing extraordinary like most sushi places in lv they are owned by korean folks not japanese if you know your sushi you know it is not the same it is ok if you want sushi on the go go to raku for authentic sushi the real japanese style pricey but worth it make reservations ahead of time at raku

A8s89uUoUVbTwDwhJ7yH0Q 3 i do like the bellagio buffet its a toss up between mandalay bay and bellagio french food is what they say this place is about although i do not eat any kind of seafood i have to say they have the best selection of crab they had the alaskan king crab and the snow crab in buckets this place is like crab heaven if you like crab they have melted butter that you can scoop up to your hearts content and they have champagne in a glass now not in those cheapy plastic containers they do in other casinos i like the salad selection and of course the choices in bread i do not eat bread although i love bread because of the high carb content but enough about that the bread had to be tried it was delicious and they had real butter on the side soft butter not the frozen kind the butter was at room temperature so it was easy to spread it on your bread yum alright downside to this place is you have to be ready to wait it felt like a line at disneyland to get into one of those rides the line was long we waited 75 minutes to be seated and we stayed for 2 hours inside prepare to wait folks it is worth the wait but do not come here starving hungry because you will wait and you will end up grouchy and impatient by the time you get to the cashier eat enough for about an hour wait and then be ready to feast happy eating1
LrylCL8k3Ab7UdTwINgQSw 3 great service  jace is wonderful the deep dish pizza is nothing like pizza hut but its ok the caesar salad was delish i recommend this place to anyone who likes american food 
gaBrTbzBGi2-MpdwTPjaYA 3 the ramen was good we have been to japan and the ramen is similar in taste the place is busy and small like they are in japan i recommend getting here early and be prepared to wait if you have a big party i like their shoyu ramen the gyoza was ok i thought for 500 it was a bit steep i will visit again although i am not a big fan of msg which i know for sure they have in their broth

HRw1w1luWIC5GyZc-M1nsg 3 not a bad place food was good although the serving is not a lot which can either be taken good or bad service was not bad it was bright inside which was a bit too much i think the place would be better with better lighting imo overall not bad i would eat there if i am in the area but i wont go out of my way to eat there
uS3ZWQxgZkfPsnxWSR9sCw 3 i have been to both locations it has that buffet atmosphere so there you go people taking what they want and more my hubby likes it because you get more for your money especially for dinner they have lots of seafood and fresh oyster that i do not eat but hubby does i like the mongolian bbq although i had to tell the man making it to not overcook the veggies no salad bar and some fruits love the baked bananas yum will go back because of the mongolian bbq  at least i can eat something here that i like kids are also half price yay
5M_0WRW5xHwLsAbU58GhXg 3 very good place for kids informative very cool however for me this is one of those once in a lifetime visit deal would i go there again probably not but it was a nice place to visit
5yPsKqRQ7BmtqAvCUkKQAQ 1 this place is terrible  one star is generous for this place i hope the owners realize their place is a dump the food is old and tasteless its messy and the restaurant is unkept i cannot imagine what the kitchen looks like they do have an a rating but that food is just plain bad we used to go here years ago when it had the same reputation and quality as asia buffet the place now is like the haven of people who just need something to fill their stomachs for cheap no quality no taste kind of food and cheap it is sad to see what happened to the quality of this restaurant i will never go back there unless it is a no choice kind of situation do yourself a favor and drive down to asia buffet a few dollars more and it will be worth your time and money there are also some very seedy characters in the resto bad cheap food attracts the bad customers lol
1pf5Yo1piTg-Pv9kZJ10SA 5 great place for kids to learn how to swim the pool is warmer than the ymca pool which kids love kids can swim year long and not be cold when they get out of the pool the whole room is warmer and the showers are nearby the facility is clean and the workers are friendly  kids learn at their own pace so dont expect your kids to be like michael phelps after they finish their summer classes i recommend year round classes if you want your child to be good at swimming 2 months of class is not enough to make them great swimmers i highly recommend this place for learning how to swim
nniWx2ak5gr0_G4VwB2ucw 1 careful about signing up with this facility this place is concerned about profit only selling tshirtspants etc high pressure shady sales tactics  they make it very hard to cancel your membership  the owners are only concerned about making money off of you imo please be advised learn from our experience stay away from this place very disappointing
uZ8dFllctvoI9Gj4YG6HIg 3 i like this place it is your usual busy chinese restaurant no smiling busy no nonsense waiters i like their fried fresh off the fish tank flounder mixed seafood with crispy noodles etc the prices are reasonable and they are open until 2am try and see for yourself
BCzKbTC3qHXq8M3Cqf4aCA 3 go to leah at this place she is great not a chatterbox and knows how to cut asian hair which is hard to find in lv reasonable price and no pressure sales to buy products they are close on sundays so plan ahead
ysyrCABgIDRyeR2wnjeIFQ 5 sandy is a great buyers agent she is accessible prompt and will be an advocate for you she goes out of her way to make things happen she follows up and calls you or texts you back right away i recommend her to anyone buying a home and does not know anyone she will look out for you and be your ally she is patient kind and very knowledgeable with her profession we are very lucky to have found her
Uz7zSHltHnU1vLx098n6hA 1 i read a review here so i lowered my expectations when i got there they gave me robe and your own locker to put your things in i was so far impressed i did not have to wait for very long at all and my therapist got me into the nice massage room right away my therapist was ok she was not the friendliest although i like that she was not chatty at all her pressure was not that firm i guess i could have told her to give me more pressure no water at the end of your massage like other places she disappeared after the massage never to be seen againlolthe check out was interesting there was a pimple faced teen ago boy at the desk that was not sure exactly what to say i figured a business like this will have a receptionist all the time and not an awkward boy at the check out not knowing what to say to customers i cannot even express anymore how weird the check out process was and the tip giving there was no envelope to put your tip and my therapist was no where to be found i gave her a good tip and handed it to the boy i hope she gets itoverall the customer service at this place is terrible the massage was ok i would not recommend this place unless you are just desperate for a massage this place feels like these people are just going through the motions their hearts are not in the right place and i did not feel any pride in their work  it is clean though other than thatstay away
gtKhCkG92ZBavVpjpIv4OQ 1 the place is a sit down kind of restaurant  the menu is not very helpful and the food selection is limited i am used to filipino food places like fiesta filipina where you can come in and pick any food you want quickly because its ready i was disappointed to see that it was a sit down place there is also a distinct smell to the place i dont want to say it smells bad but it was noticeably present
wCfuggZpKO01-Ke7ulld4Q 5 sunday early morning at 130am my ac in my house broke i called tim and he answered my call at 130 he came in on a sunday morning at 8am to fix my ac  it took him less than an hour to fix my ac and charge me a reasonable price   i highly recommend this company and tim thank you so much
mQQcoD6oR-utusg_juXe2g 1 its ok i have had better thai food the resto is nice inside although they are so busy maybe we got the wrong dishes but the dishes we had like the thom kha was nothing spectacular it was average i had high expectations because of what i heard from people but unfortunately it did not rise to the occassion
vOGpi51QEv_JVm7MmrRqIQ 3 massage done by joe was great pressure was just right and the shoulder massage was my favorite i was not a big fan of the ionic thing but it was ok the place was nice and quiet and they service was great i will definitely visit again and recommend this place if you are in the area
F9onJ4gLx6uIHEoiJF78-g 3 my wife and i took the tour with imbibe tours a few days after christmas we were picked up from the aria tour bus pickup area which is underground once we picked up a few more people at excalibur we were whisked away and headed out of town a surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous welcome to las vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures after this we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back all wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected no wonder most people gets the red wrong the first winery we visited was pahrump winery one of the owners gretchen was so very informative and enthusiastic she was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked following a tour and wine tasting we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch this lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour my wife and i being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines which i highly recommend some of the wines that werent on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously we picked out several of our tastings and gretchens friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home we also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to alan to load onto the bus for us we were then on the road again and headed to the next winery i would say that after the first winery the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience but i was to be mistaken the second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and i both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket as well the tasting room was a bit homey i hope they can make it work eventually but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop on our way back alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time im not entirely sure that alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on i would also encourage alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing themif someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine listen enthusiastically and respond positively aside from these notes the tour is great for the value those who love amazing wine great food and education on how a winery runs will not be disappointed
qv65IQbhyJT9MeJHTv6hNQ 3 best margaritas around the food is all a la cart which is quite different from typical mexican fair very unique flavors the place is spotless inside with some nice artwork definitely a goto if you like mexican
7Q-yPX6J3qJ82gjBskTVwg 5 weekly wine tasting events give a great chance for everyone to try wines from all over the world 5 per person gets you a tasting of 56 wines brian is so very knowledgable about their wines and is not afraid to give you his personal opinion instead of the usual tasting notes you get from others elsewhere i would highly recommend this place if for no other reason than the amazing selection they have from all over the world mentioning a varietal appellation region food pairing or any other descriptor will get you a list of suggestions i would highly recommend working through their selectionsthe wine cellar has some interesting finds as well
jTOx-q05xX6pWsFtpnAtDg 3 my wife and i had an early dinner here on a monday the staff was friendly and helpful but it was obvious that the other waiter was much more interested in customer service than our waitress our waitress read off some specials but we overheard the other waiter reading off a much more extensive list and go out of his way to make his diners much more comfortablethe food was ok but overpriced for what we received i would not recommend getting anything with snap peas as the chef does not know to trim the stem ends off of the peas the risotto also seems to be a favorite as it is a side with many entrees however it is a bit dense gordon ramsey would not approve it is very obvious that they are doing their best to make this establishment work but i think they still need to update themselves a bit in order to draw a younger crowd at present it is a blue hair establishment this may be the image they are looking to portray and clientele they are looking to attract but the image discourages those under 40 from dining herei would also look to update the wine list at present they have a wide range but these are the very traditional and wellknown megawinery names i would like to see some more unique items on the list
XLjcRFnHLVKJl6PXQ2CjoQ 3 this stop is a gem on the strip situated on the second floor of the cromwell hotel across las vegas blvd from caesars palace the view is excellent depending on the time of day and your seating location you may even take in a view of the bellagio fountain show the service was a bit slow and we spent roughly 15 minutes there before anyone came to our table but our server seemed to have a number of tables so we can certainly understand the delay we were there for lunch and as this was a special occasion we brought our own bottle of wine the corking fee was a bit high but not for vegas prices at 35 but it was still a steal considering that almost every wine on the list was an ultra premium wine once we ordered our food came out exceptionally fast we highly recommend the baked pasta of the day the buratta cheese buffalo mozzarella baby sweet peppers and marinated olives our total dining experience lasted over 1 12 hrs we were so fulfilled by the time we left in the end when our check came we found that the corking fee was not on it this may have been due to the fact that we bought so many dishes during lunch or maybe our overwhelmed server simply forgot but we werent complaining  i would highly recommend giadas for lunch  all their food is fresh and homemade which is somewhat rare these days even on the strip
QudEmPtjfAQ8WlawsUKCTw 3 one of the best places in tempe to get a latenight snack that isnt horrible for you  im guilty of not always or even usually going with the most healthy options but the sheiftalia platter has got to be better for me than a burger and fries right  their tzaziki is bomb the sheiftalia is delicious and tender and juicy and coated in just the right amount of lemonyness and their pitas are thick and soft the way they should be  theyre open til 330 am and they deliver  if you love good food and like to eat at weird hours of the night do it here  you wont regret it
TfxIr9dkQK9ZcKmDhGqEbQ 3 this is the some of the yummiest chinese food ive had since moving to az and absolutely the yummiest chinese delivery i have had since moving here  ive only found three or four places total that have delivered and all of them have been mediocre or worse except for asia lee  everything ive gotten from them is delicious last time i ordered szechuan beef pork egg foo yung and the free chicken fried rice that comes with any order of 15 or more  i wasnt a huge fan of the pork that came with the egg foo yung but the egg patties themselves are savory and delightful  the szechuan beef is my absolute favorite and it made a great lunch when i reheated it the next day as welll  ive never been inside the restaurant so i cant vouch either way for the last review but honestly why would i go to the restaurant when i can have all the yumminess delivered right to my door
61LX4t_LBGvy00fWB27DWg 3 okay so i might be a total weirdo but i wake up craving pei weis fried rice some days  there is very little i enjoy more than waking up hungry at 10 am on one of my days off logging on to pei weis website and ordering fried rice just the way i like it without having to explain it to anyone and risk them writing it down wrong  im antisocial so what  then i know that when they open at 11 am they will have my very special order of fried rice hot and ready waiting for me  the portions are huge so a 67 order of fried rice can last me up to four meals which is an awesome if not exactly healthy deal  i dont really like much of their other food that ive tried  theres some sort of curry dish that was nice but im sticking to my fried rice with extra egg  yum
EbrD4_4AZDeVwh2k8-USXw 1 their specials menu is extremely misleading  i went there on a wednesday and according to the menu you get 50 cent drafts with any entree  so i ordered an entree and asked what they had on draft  apparently that wasnt specific enough because my beers were 5 a pop  the waitress played dumb and when i spoke to a manager he treated me like an idiot for not asking for the draft specials rather than the drafts  that language is nowhere on the menu  he told me if i didnt want to pay that much we were going to have a problem  he didnt even offer any sort of discount or anything claiming that he didnt write the menu  i paid and left and ill never go back simply because theyre purposefully misleading and expect their drunk customers not to ask questions at the end of the night also the stalls in the womens restroom have no locks  charging five bucks for a plastic cup of beer they should be able to afford to get that fixed
Zl-eGpZWSMLeDiYYa7sbRA 5 this is my goto bar  im not into the scene at places where theres a lot of loud obnoxious frat boys  four peaks isnt especially quiet mind you  they play pretty good music for the most part and almost every time ive started to groan because of the song that just came on someone who works there changes it  the service is a little slow usually but i honestly dont care  the food is amazing and the beer  oh the beer  i love the sunbru for warmer days and the oatmeal stout when its chillier out  i always end up drinking a little more than i planned because theyre so delicious and that leads to me splurging on appetizers  my favorite is the spinach artichoke dip  all of their beers are worth trying since they brew them there youre not going to get them anywhere outside of az as far as im aware  if you dont know where to start for 9 you can order the sampler and get a tiny glass of each kind of beer they brew then decide for yourself  short version good food good beer oneofakind establishment go now
kO4ObhlJR-LmucOzHg2ovA 1 me and a friend ordered delivery through grubhub which was fine  the bill with tip came to about 50 for two entrees and a dessert which even for delivery seems high  i recently paid 65 for chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials crab puffs 8 delivery charge and tip  i ordered the pineapple fried rice i love spicy food im the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness i ordered this dish at a 6 thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness this was one of the spiciest dishes i have ever been served it was inedible because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless which is something ive never experienced before so there was no balancing sweet flavor it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything i am with a friend who also loves spicy food and it was too much for him too he ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3 which seemed to have no bite at all mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his it was at least 10 times as spicy ive ordered 8s and 9s that werent this hot he also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple my friends level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine it was crab fried rice  it wasnt anything special just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab  we ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach minei am addicted to sticky rice its one of my alltime favorite desserts bangkok thais sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag apparently directly out of the microwave with a coconut milk sauce that didnt have nearly enough sugar it was overall bland i tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it they turned out to be peanuts which i dont love to begin with but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what youre eating you know that its not very flavorful the coconut custard was ok but not amazing ive definitely had better i used to live near thai lotus and would frequently get delivery from them their sticky rice with custard was amazing im really sad theres no decent nonpizza places that deliver to my new apartment for a 50 delivery order i was extremely disappointed worst 50 ive ever spent on a meal
ZcjiVPOEZzXwW-he9_-jeA 5 i love dutch bros  im a dedicated punchcard holder addicted to iced kickers which are their irishcream flavored specialty  theyre really rich though just so you know what youre getting into before you take my advice  they make it with cream but you can also get it with less fatty milks or soy milk  if you want the full experience get the cream though  i also love that their prices are all in increments of 025 including tax  its just a nice touch  
LSs3-12JEnYY6XqDdPPtnA 5 oh what a wonderful experience  my boyfriend and i were going a little nuts on groupon yesterday i think we purchased 3 different deals when we discovered a groupon now for thai buffet  my boyfriend is a huge buffet fan and we both love thai food  he got really really excited and i couldnt say no so we purchased our final deal of the day went and ran some errands and finished off at thai buffetwe were the only ones there at that time but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch i think we arrived around 415ish  the buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself but it is all you can eat  joann the owner described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad  we couldnt say no to any of the dishes they all looked super amazing  and they weremy favorite was probably the green curry it wasnt as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it which i love  everything tasted more homemade than restauranty for lack of a better descriptor  i felt like i was in a thai grandmas kitchen and it was awesomeas we finished our massive plates of food joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango pumpkin custard and sticky rice  this might have been my favorite part of the meal but its hard to say because it was all so good  im a total sucker for sticky rice thoughdefinitely will be back  you get a great value for the price even without a groupon the buffet is 999person with quality eats and very friendly service
-Ll2ySx7XmteA4pIppNjiQ 1 my main problem with the cornish pasty company is inconsistency  ive had pasties that were simply divine and i kept going back  once i started getting ones that were a little icky i just assumed they were having an off day  i stopped going after my boyfriend and i got sick  i really want to like this place and i do like some things about it  the crust on the pasties is always fab but the fillings are hit or miss  i always got either the oggie or the pilgrim and the oggie was more consitently good  once i tried the pilgrim it became my instant favorite since is had turkey and stuffing inside and came with cranberry sauce for dipping  but like i said their lack of consistency as well as the fact that i got sick last time i went has made me not want to give them any more chances
VUAwquKwz69H8zbXtn8q6g 5 my boyfriend and i are super broke right now so were taking advantage of our groupon credits  we were hungry and 5  diner was one of the groupon now options  i was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious so i went for the waffle with strawberries and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke  as im writing this he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy so im doing that now before i forget  i had a sip and i can verify that he speaks the truth  my waffle hit the spot it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what i wanted  my boyfriend cleared his plate as well  our server was super attentive and friendly and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us  all in all a very positive experience especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food  well definitely be returning soon  as a side note i had been here once before a long long time ago and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well  as a side side note i dont know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about
fvmbDYauSiZ20PapoJygMQ 5 the employees are for the most part very friendly and right now theyve got some sweet deals going on for candy  2 sodas 2 candies and a popcorn for 5 or 1 soda 1 candy and 1 popcorn for 3  plus they give out free gift cards for preordering movies and games  they also have a new thing called direct access where if theres a movie or game title that they dont have in the store they can have it mailed to you within 23 business days for the same price as renting it in the store  you can mail it back when youre done or bring it back to the store for 3 off a movie rental or 4 off a game rental  sweeeet
zQUqDmqQ17mdkb3TcSGz8A 5 i am addicted to veneziasa while back a coworker picked up a slice for me and i was not impressed  i dont know what was wrong with me  i retried venezias on my lunch break four days ago and i have eaten there every day since  i brought my boyfriend there and he is obsessed as well  i am boring and usually just get cheese pizza but my boyfriend always gets the slice of the day and raves about it whatever it is  i also got the combo b last night a slice of pizza with a small salad and a drink and the salad was impressively good  the balsamic dressing was excellent too  everyone should try this place out  the pizza slices are huge delicious and satisfying
R_7XYxXrJ7nZ0_Tdj9ns9A 3 i crave ono from time to time  i wish it was closer to my apartment  i still swing by for some chicken katsu whenever i get the chance because it is tasty and delicious and katsu sauce is addictive  my boyfriend is more adventurous than me and he literally always is in the mood to go here  he especially enjoys the spare ribs bbq combo and the spam musubi  we both love the macaroni salad  i get why someone said there was too much mayo and i guess by some standards its a little plain but thats what i like about it  people who say the rice is boring are obviously right but theyre forgetting to put soy sauce or katsu sauce or whatever they want on it  its plain white rice guys what do you think its going to taste like  they also have these super tasty canned hawaiian beverages at the counter that we both highly recommend  oh and if you have a smaller appetite definitely go for the smaller plate option  my eyes tend to be larger than my stomach and i can never finish the fullsized katsu plate but the smaller one is just right actually still a little more than i can eat usually and its only about 5  awesome
1nIrMXZ63lQkMtAesuNyMQ 5 amazing wine list fantastic pizzas with unusual toppings and gnutella crepes for dessert  it doesnt get any better  not to mention that the service is excellent and friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming something that you dont usually experience in a place as hip as cibo  i get nervous going out to trendy places because im scared of getting dirty looks from rich people but this was not my experience at cibo  just sitting on their patio is a relaxing experience what with the lovely foliage glass of wine and beardy waiter  i always want to go back when ive got the cash  great for a date or special event
XvxR3pFbQVHSg-J1LjM09A 1 today was my second or third time coming to paradise but i wouldnt call it that if i had a choicei ordered the chicken katsu which is a favorite of mine when it comes to hawaiian food  i was disappointed that it was especially chewy and that they served it with bbq sauce instead of katsu sauce  it just didnt taste quite right  the lady working there wasnt particularly friendly either  ill just go to ono next time i hear the call of katsu
panwOEsDuMoypXyLgbUcOw 5 i am a couscous addict and this is my goto place  everything ive tried here is wonderful though and i love the attached market
yqf2Kj40F9eGB_L_SCoRXQ 5 best french fries  everalso they have great onion rings fried zucchini hot dogs  i dont eat burgers really so i cant speak to those  i am obsessed with their tuna salad thoughi never thought id be ordering tuna salad sandwiches regularly from anywhere  tuna salad has a tendency to be that unpleasant gray or pinkish color and have a tinge of fishiness to it if its not fresh enough  that is never the case at chicago hamburger co  this might sound strange but their tuna salad is the most pleasant pale green color i have ever seen  its because they put relish in it  lots of delicious relish  i am in love with their sandwiches and although i used to devoutly order polish sausages  fries i cant turn my back on my new love  not the first thing people think of ordering when they come here but its definitely worth a try
Evu46hmPljDfH0xYw43KOw 1 same deal as everyone else  i bought the livingsocial deal and emailed them through their website as soon as i got the voucher  i never got a reply but i didnt mind because the instructions did say to call a specific number to schedule as opposed to going through their website  about a week after my initial email i called and left a voicemail at the number listed on the voucher  never got a call back  today my boyfriend called to try and schedule a cleaning and the number on the voucher is no longer in service  their website has also been disabled  ive requested a refund from livingsocial
PPepHS43hbNTnav1DQDpog 3 i was here for a conference in april and this was probably the most beautiful hotel ive stayed in the staff and service was wonderful and the provided food was more than satisfactory wifi was a decent speed except in the lobby and was free to members who join their loyalty programthe main issue i had was with the room i stayed in the first night it faced another room and therefore didnt have much natural light i also couldnt leave the curtains open if i wanted privacy the worst part was the noise there was a low pitched humming from air conditioning equipment outside the room the noise wasnt incredibly loud but it was very grating and made it difficult to get work done or sleep the next day i asked for a new room the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating and did not make me feel like a nuisance i got a room that was much quieter faced the street instead of another room and had better natural light i just wish this was true for all the roomsoverall 5 stars for service 2 stars for the first room and 4 stars for the second room
bCzzir-O8YmOdVKtinPARQ 5 tried out this new location and wow amazing i will be back for sure everyone is so friendly and service is spot on our meal was delicious and the music was great cant wait to try more things on the menu this place is a winner
7PIHoRMzGpR7FI5C9jGhpw 1 went to wallys last night and all i can say is yikes the biggest disappointment ive experienced in a long time what used to be this hidden gem with the comfort of home vibe with perfectly cooked home cooked food and staff that treated you like family has now become just like every other restaurant in scottsdale way over priced for poor quality of food staff that doesnt care anymore management that doesnt care anymore my favorite waitress is gone which i guess is no surprise seeing what the owner chris did to this place if i wanted to eat at grassroots or twisted grove then i would drive a few blocks down and eat there wallys was something amazing something special that is so hard to find in a restaurant these daysnow its ruined now is disgusting now its a complete waste of your time and hard earned money dont bother trying it out trust me i will not be back to this one i would much rather drive to the other location on camelback that has remained the old wallys way worth the drive
KiKChQV4kvN_FfAdfpZBZA 5 i came into wallys  last night for dinner with my wife and another couple we were seated at a large round table in the corner on the patio our server candy was amazing what a gem she is i have never had a more remarkable server seated next to us was a very large rambunctious group of ladies if i can even call them ladies the disgusting display of disrespect towards candy was something i have never seen before they were behaving like they were in a night club and to watch them bark orders at her and to treat her as if she was a slave to them was horrifying but even more astonishing was how candy carried herself through it all that smile never left her face i hope those women wake up today feeling completely ashamed of themselves especially the one who did all of this in front of her teenage sons i hope i never see any of the women in wallys again and no server here ever has to go through what candy went through
cVqk88yeuTgIMok3vf6y2g 1 place was old looked dirty so i didnt bother ordering i value my health so i wont eat there
92JtUaqxOmcfwKyILCd3rw 1 they do a bad job of repairing flats theyll probably make you get a new tire and thats expensive but the worst thing is the tire will more than likely have a slow leak meaning youll probably be going back again and wasting more time that is what happened to me
3-5FIQAFtL3AjUCiu3bgWQ 1 last few times i made the mistake of using beck and not city taxi beck taxied smell bad and the drivers dont seem to know the city well i wont be using them any time soon
0KGq-QBoTY5b_RH4_3HBIg 5 just go  unbelievable duck tacos sublime filet really how does one make onion rings so good you want more same for the grits good gritswtf  fiance said lamb was so good she didnt know that lamb was supposed to taste like that  service great attentive without being a pain  sit outside if you can inside is noisy and small but smells really good as the kitchen is pretty open no doors between it and dining  this was top 3 in my memorable dining experience  everyone has a bad day i guess hence some of the bad reviews but go 
pGm9RZt6IkgXOuxiYvXMcw 5 great french cooking cozy atmosphere reasonably priced highly recommended
Bvy6q9dzLgAUYtIvwyGyOQ 5 we love shaunas doggy day care its close to home and her hours are convenient and she offers half day services which are quite useful when you just need to run a few errands but dont want a crazy puppy on your hands when you get home she has supplies but we havent bought anything yet although we plan too also offers grooming service which we havent used either but will in the future
tAcnAtL0cyTSkmoR2tncBA 5 this place is as good as they say it is and more weve been there twice once with another couple who were grumpy about the whole experience and thus made our experience less than par we were expecting the wait but they were still irritated about it they werent nice to the staff the staff thus wasnt nice to us however the pizza is absolutely amazing so we went back a second time just me and my husband our experience was much more delightful we enjoyed a bottle of wine during our three hour wait and therefore were not drunk as one reviewer suggests and excellent conversation the ambiance is wonderful the staff was very friendly since we were friendly to them we were not rushed to eat quickly although the pizza is so good it is hard not to shovel it in your mouth overall we were quite pleased and look forward to going again im not sure how one reviewer said it cost her 70 for her meal pizzas are 10 to 12 im sure soda isnt all that expensive and salads range from 69 must have left a pretty good tip weve had the biancoverde and rosa as well as the spiedini for an appetizer delish i just love this place and wish i could go more often its how pizza should be made
ar_MNFXRITdkU5tLmNXcqg 5 i love local business especially when they have great customer service like toshis i too have had the green tea smoothie and what a delightful treat it was ive also had their blended coffee and iced coffee both far exceed the quality of that s coffee place whats so great about the blended drinks at toshis is that they shock actually blend all the ice at the s place i usually have chunks of ice at the bottom which greatly annoys me not so at toshis and they always toast the bagels which is great they have limited outdoor seating and they dont mind if you bring your wellbehaved dogs oh and i almost forgot to mention the most important partthey roast their own coffee on site so you know that you are getting very fresh coffee and you can tellthe taste is so smooth and not even a little bitter now what are you waiting for you know you want to go to toshis
wdfuhnbb7uoGw2E_maB8qA 3 paradise is good wildflower is better but there is no wildflower in surprise so paradise it is as others have said the tomato soup is quite delicious im also a big fan of the salad with cranberriesbut the name escapes me right now the turkey wrap is averagelacking flavor the breakfast quiche is also average i think mine had been sitting out for a while so maybe a fresh one would taste better cookies are good but it is hard to screw up cookies the salads are gigantic seriously who needs a salad that big i guess if you want it for lunch dinner and lunch the next day what a deal it can be a bit confusing the first time you are there since there are two lines but you figure out that one is for the bakery one is for the rest of the food cafeteria stylewhy do i like wildflower better i think their sandwiches are better and the soup as well the only soup i like at paradise is the tomato soup the others are lacking i need flavor i like the ambiance at wildflower better too although there is much more seating at the surprise paradise vs the goodyear wildflower overall not a bad place to get a fresh salad for lunch
f6It8U64UiH01hM196HP7g 1 i should have read reviews before heading here i had heard from several folks that this was a good place to eat and we had heard that the wings were out of this world yeah not quitefirst of all the ambiance is not that great lots of small loud children the service was very average we had three servers ask us if we had been helped yet which i suppose is a good thing but they all seemed very confused and not sure if we were their table but good that they asked our actual server took quite a while to greet us and of course he forgot my water brought the beer though we started with wings and we wanted to split themtwo flavors at first he told us we couldnt do that even though it says right on the menu that you can he made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by splitting them for us they tasted more like chicken fingers and not wings way too much breading i had the california burger hubby had the fish and chips the burger was overdone but i expected it would be so i ordered it medium to get it to medium well it was well done thankfully i didnt order well done otherwise it wasnt bad for this kind of place i also order the potato chips as a side since they make them there the chips were burnt  the fish was seriously over breaded apparently they like doing that here and way too big the baked potato and cole slawvery average now all that being saidour bill was very cheap 33 and that included two beers wings and two entrees want cheap food and average service go here otherwise try somewhere else
78Kn5oz-zD4_71VL5sNrZg 5 we went here for a belated valentines dinner it was fantastic parking was a pain but we eventually found a spot they seated us immediately we had reservations and our server was very attentive they immediately brought out bread delish and water not long after our wine arrived speaking of wine dont be scared when you see the wine listi didnt see any wines by the glass only bottles so i simply told the server what i wanted and there it was i had the tagliatelle sp pasta with wild mushrooms so good im a big fan of earthy tasty yumminess and this hit the spot why cant i do this at home oh and the soup divine the special was potato and leek soup perfectly smooth must have been strained several times to get it this smooth very comforting hubby had the mac  cheese for an apyum that vermont cheddar is just too good he had the pork chop for his entree and i will never be able to make pork chops at home again oh well he thoroughly enjoyed it for dessert we had the iron chef apples which were perfect we were pretty full by this point but these three adorable little tasty apples were just the right finishing touchthe second best part of our night the food was first of course was meeting mark tarbell i tried not to act like a fool but i watched him on iron chef so it was cool to meet him he was very friendly very down to earth and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience he was walking around to all the tablesgreat chef so for a nice night out you cant beat this place enjoy
1vvHy4nGgdXwWfH4Ab-FzQ 5 we had a fantastic experience here we went on a thursday evening and with the misters on it was still very pleasant sitting outside even in june the wine list was extremely affordable  most between 25 and 60 for scottsdale this is a steal we shared an appetizer and a main entree the appetizer was delish grilled bread perfectly grilled not so hard that it hurts your gums with three spreads  an amazing goat cheese and marscapone eggplant and hummus also they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter for our entree we shared the fish special which was a sea bass with artichokes fingerling potatoes and spinach fantastic the service was also great ive come to expect any service in scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasnt maybe we were lucky but i enjoyed our experience
xbCOS7iV8KtUCG5hdSUGhQ 5 mmmmmbreadoh sorry im supposed to be writing a review wildflower is easily our favorite place for lunch and breakfast too this place is always clean always busy and ordering is always easy we usually get the same thing every visit since it is so tasty we both get the potato cream cheese soup no matter what time of year yes it is that good i get the chicken and feta and hubby gets the blt even at half size these sandwiches are plenty to fill up on and if we feel we can spare the extra calories we will get a cupcake to go yum ive also had a salad cant recall which one but it was fantastic as well sometimes well also get a loaf of bread to go and weve varied the kind all have been greatnow breakfastah that was just divine i got the lemon ricotta melt in your mouth pancakes with fruit topping my mouth is watering just thinking about it and i got the apple sausage on the side it was a little dry but no matter since i was so full on the pancakes all i needed was a mimosa moving on hubby got the banana walnut pancakes which werer also oh so scrumptious so we love supporting this place and think it kicks paradises butt we are wishing and praying that they would bring one to surprise although that might not be good for my waistline
WITHAta7tSvZJdRpkqb_ug 5 i love the ice cream here course ive never seen baby roaches thankfully while the place isnt spotless it is clean i love the decor very charming and the employees are always friendly ive had shakes and sundaes here both have been very good also they sell pup cupsa frozen yogurt treat for your four legged kids my dogs love these pup cups and at 125its a great treat for them when it is so hot out and it is a local storeso all the more reason to support it
-_BKaXQCBgupepxlv52-Qg 3 ive been to babbos several times since it is so close to my house my two favorites are the pasta martini and the gorgonzola salad the bread is excellent and ive had no issues with the wine so maybe ive been lucky ive also had their pizza i cant recall which one but it was excellent with peppers and goat cheese the ambiance is great as well and prices are very reasonable the reason im not giving it 5 stars is because the service has been sketchy at times but it isnt so bad that we wont return overall a good place
0txptKvnnQY0oACr-ez0FQ 1 i have mixed feelings about this place i love the concept but the owner seems to only provide good customer service to his important customers ive been in here several times and each time i felt as though he didnt really want us there my dogs are well behaved and ive promoted his ice cream socials and told him so but i still felt as though i was not welcomed i may not be as regular as some customers but i still deserve good customer service im not willing to pay high prices if i dont get good treatment i want to support his business since he is local but apparently he doesnt want my business
UVl6P7OmIexCctcIimKM1w 3 we checked this place out to compare prices to target and other grocery stores what i foundprices are essentially the same since i enjoy shopping at target so much more it is my happy place i will continue to shop at target and the grocery store closer to my house the good pointsit is clean and well organized and in the frozen section the lights dont come on unless you are standing in front of it nice touchkeeps the food in a dark cold area while conserving energy but walmart just isnt my thing and if the prices arent cheaper then off to target i go
ptWGasplfjFQkqWB8gznyA 3 weve only had bronocs once we had it delivered and it was average pizza the sauce was too thick and too much tomato flavor the crust was average as well it tasted more like certain chain pizza stores that i avoid but it is a step up from them since their cheese tasted better but i am a major pizza addict usually make my own so i am very particular their customer service was good and the pizza was hot when it arrived but the taste just wasnt that great its been a while since we tried maybe well try again sometime and see if it has improved
0jg4v_u5jOs8Jr1k1UnHMA 3 ok so service isnt always the best the workers can often be clueless and even rude luckily i know target very well so i dont need these workers i can find it myself the cashiers are hit and miss sometimes they dont even mutter hello but whatever im at target yeah its my happy place they always have fun stuff and great prices things are always well stocked at least the workers have that part figured out i can easily drop 100 here even though i just went in for toothpaste how its one of the mysteries of the world i suppose so when im trying to save money i dont go here if i really need something i do not repeat do not get a cart but a basket that way i cant fit much in my basket i think target is a girl thing guys dont really get it but if you are a girl you get it its target
1NTh8_PYneaNLTEVUZP8_A 3 weve been to tokoyo lobby twice both times were great ill start by saying i gave it four stars instead of five because it is small small small inside and the ambiance isnt fantastic but the things you must do for good sushi i cant recall for certain the name of our favorite roll but i believe it was the glendale roll deep fried goodness is all i can say i know it isnt traditional sushi but i just cant do raw fish nuff said we tried two other kinds which were good as well but the deep fried goodness overshadowed the other ones and i have erased them from my memory the pot stickers were ok not fabulous the green tea was great and came in cute little tea pots i havent had sake here and i dont know why since i usually get sake guess id better head back for some more sake and sushi
pX6jULXlfFLN_IgWeAPfYw 5 vogue bistro is by far the best restaurant in surprise why you ask oh so many reasons lets begin1 it is not a chain restaurant it is locally owned by a well trained chef 2 the food ok maybe this should be number one but with the dominance of chain restaurants in surprise i think it is important that it is not a chain but the food is fantastic i havent had a thing i didnt love my favorite is the vogue burger its big but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it the toppings are perfect not overwhelming and the meat melts in your mouth all that yumminess for only 8 what a deal  ive also had the sweet potatoe fries make sure you ask for the dipping sauces the garden panini the chicken panini and the chicken salad yes weve been there a few times all were fantastic 3 the alcohol no i am not an alcoholic but this is worth mentioning the drinks here are great i usually get wine while my hubby will get beer both lists are great and reasonably priced a great white wine for 6glass also the martinis are fabulous they shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties but what i love most about the martinis is that they are sweet but not blast of sugar sweet often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor not here they are just perfect4 it has very chic decor lots of outdoor seating which isnt great this time of year but is fabulous when arizona has nice weather when does that happen again moving on5 the manager and owners are awesome we havent been there once that they didnt stop by for a chat6 it is local i am a huge supporter of local businesses which can be extremely challenging in surprise ok now for a couple minor negatives these are not significant enough to drop the star rating in my humble opinion 1 sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking i think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning so we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation 2 it can be crazy busy i guess that isnt a bad thing necessarily but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to vogue luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there so there you go the best restaurant in surpriseyou will wonder what the heck it is doing in surprise it is more scottsdalelike but without the snobbiness no offense to you scottsdale folk
Dkl2s5_FxH1U0OvybS263Q 3 ok normally i like to support local over big chains but ive always had a good experience at this petsmart the cashiers are always friendly the store is clean and most of the time i can find what i need minus one time they were out of vitamins i wish they had more organic and natural products but since i feed my dogs mostly fresh food this isnt an issue they have a great selection of holiday items so i am looking forward to what they have this year and ive had no problem returning items if i needed to plus they have adoption drives
Eoxg-VhiE2lDyg1aSpMbCQ 5 we absolutely love sprouts we shop here almost exclusively only at other stores for things that we cant get or the price is too high to justifybut that includes very few items the produce is always fantastic and cheap then meat is so tasty and fresh and the cheeseoh i just love the cheese section the cheese is cheaper than what you will find at other grocery storeswe did a price comparison i know when i shop at sprouts i am not getting overly processed full of preservatives i am getting fresh food what a concept huh and the bulk section is fantastic i love being able to buy spices and flour and anything else you can think of especially the chocolate covered toffees in just the amount i need then it is always fresh and i dont have to wonder how long ive had that dried rosemary and it is a local arizona store which makes me even happier
vae_PBKFlbBKRT43_l8f5Q 3 i went to tomo with a very large group around 18 folks we had a reservation things didnt start out so goodthe manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didnt want to split the checks after we explained that none of us had brought cash seriously who pays with cash anymore he left for a bit and then came back and said we could split the check so i believe they were just being lazy since they ended up splitting the check anyway if they had wanted us to pay with cash they should have informed us when we made the reservations poor management overall the serves did a good job though after this incident moving along to the food the green tea was unlike other green tea that i have had it had a nutty taste to it that i didnt care for perhaps that is more authentic i dont know but it wasnt what i was expecting and didnt drink it the miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly hubby and i shared the gyoza and the spider sushi the gyoza was crunchy but not too crunchy and came in a boat nice presentation the sushi was good too nothing out of this world but good another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great it had scallops mussels and shrimp i didnt try it though so cant say for sure and the hot sake was great always good to have hot sake with my sushi and to finish it all offthe green tea ice cream now this was delicious and my favorite part of the evening nice and creamy not overly sweet but just sweet enough bottom line dont go with large groups unless you have cash sushi is ok but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip
bwOHJLyDoy-jr5hI8M9j3Q 5 he did good work on my sv650 abs general maintenance and handle bar conversion  planning on getting more work done in the future
0D_GV74HvR3O5vMq590dbw 1 not for me  they sit you on a recliner wet your feet while massaging your head felt like they were shampooing me  very uncomfortable position for my back    then the masseusse asks you to turn over while fully reclining the chair and works your back with the elbows   i did not like it at all felt like it was too rough on me and am already showing a couple of bruises  i paid 36 for the 1 hour including 30 minutes back massage   too loud no privacy cells ringing employees talking in a foreign language just too disturbing and i also have a headache now  i am an expert on swedish and thai massages on a massage table with the masseuse using her hands and a complete silent environment but this was a far cry from relaxing  the masseusse was a sweet lady but the experience was not good at all
AYDf8R-v3QP-3uzBN9pAcg 1 this place is a train wreck the owner and management should be embarrassed to have such an under trained staff also the quality of food is all over the place sometimes good and sometimes horrible its really sad how often we go someplace else just because of the low quality and horrible costumer service when it could all be fixed so easily boooooo
5pwgzwE3GFlpF1JcEpyYig 5 just had a great experience with ronald he showed right when they said he would and told us exactly what was wrong with our oven very fair price in a very timely manner also extremely polite and friendly like all the other reviews i highly recommend absolute and will call them any time i need a appliance repaired

BXmdY7qWBrzkbvXI10Q6YQ 1 got take out nothing to write home about i guess everything is relative but this food was less than mediocre sorry
V8-exiXirxKwshtnvZxqZA 5 the food was amazing i got the steak handheld with a homemade bleu cheese sauce it was unbelievable and the beer selection was great if you get mac and cheese and like heat try adding just a touch of siracha sauce twothumbs up the plates were moderately priced but a little steep if you were expecting pub prices 14 for my sandwich good for me though i had bet my friend before we went in about the quality of food and i won the food was great wish i had a local bar like that in my neighborhood
KIiQWswrHJktBsdOYYI1ng 1 giving a star cause i have too sat for 15 min and wasnt even acknowledged i told the manager and it seemed like he didnt care i got out of there horrible customer service
DnPEfsosyWY3Qb5fq-9m7A 1 truly the most horrific customer service i have ever experienced in retail their return policy is horrible everyone in the store acts like you are inconveniencing them by being there and their store manager was so incredibly rude and unhelpful i bought three expensive pieces of furniture for my new home and every single one of them was broken in the box or was not constructed properly to put together i will never shop here again
tHAgCklH79cdDV2WF51Etw 1 i saw the reviews and came to this place idk if these people ever ate good thai food but this was the worst thai food we ever hadthe meat and veggies were stale no wonder they were so quick

2dxXXOY9RROl8RMC5l7FJQ 3 this was ok not great but not horrible either the sushi is good for a sushi fix but i dont think its as fresh as saga normally is the service was bad im sure it was our section or something but two tables that were seated after us were served before us were not that picky so it didnt bother us too bad but it was at least 10 minutes before we got drinks other than that if youre looking for a chain sushi place to get some ok food that will hold you over then this is good for that
CsJqzabQFNQ9ik_xSJ2Ykw 5 this place has been a fantastic find for us in moon pizza is awesome better than the other options around here same with the other pasta dishes we would highly recommend this place delivery is quick weve always been happy
F9mnLSkFbAgOIyqrmwhnkA 3 selmas is really good not bbq pitmasters great but very good for pittsburgh the pulled pork is fantastic i highly recommend the big pig wrangler add a hot sausage to the pulled pork sandwich i see other reviews looking for bbq perfection and this isnt it but if youre craving some bbq and living or visiting here in pittsburgh this place will do the trick
Cf9a7A51708CPQB6j5cN3w 5 this is my favorite place to eat real breakfast no fake eggs no garbage sysco food they have excellent pancakes and change them up throughout the seasons the owner is fantastic the food is fantastic what else can i say the only bad thing is if youre not there early prepare to wait because its tiny inside and everyone wants to eat there

8OX8zfjDKUEcR3p_S1o-PQ 3 studio 326 was a great salon for my 13 year old niece she wanted to go short and thats exactly what she received karen was her stylist and she was phenomenal very welcoming and sweet towards my niece however when we walked in another stylist was dying her hair and her kids and significant other were receiving haircuts from here when clients were waiting a bit of time passed and all of a sudden another stylist started to fix his own hair up so at this time 2 stylists were doing their own hair as time goes on the male stylist starts to smoke his evape in the studio the work they do is quite incredible however they need to work on professionalism

ZLTA1fHTLYV88m5rTiSONg 3 out of convenience while staying at the wekopa hotel my wife and i dined at the ahnala mesquite room thinking it a risk based on some negative yelp reviews  my wife had the halibut and i had the filet mignon we both found our meals delicious flavorful with a flair and served hot   the artisanal dinner rolls were piping hot and we particularly enjoyed the seeded rolls  my filet was well seasoned and covered with blue cheese crumbles that i crave  the hollandaise sauce for the filet and asparagus was a nice addition  if you are nearby take a risk but know that our gamble paid out a jackpot of a meal
pqb_AHWJ6anL8KJw_iRDJg 1 what a disappointment  bought a water lily on mothers day and its not growing  when i called about the guarantee was told i never should have planted it that early so the guarantee is void  when i bought the lily specifically asked the clerk if it was ok to plant that day and he said it was  now they wont replace the plant because i should have known not to plant so early  trickers really   theyre living up to their name
mK9Z7wdt87Xv2Ov-xVDeHg 1 absolute worst nail salon experience of my life i will never go back i urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as i got there it was bleeding profusely dripping down my arm and onto the counter which she didnt clean up the whole time and her response to this was to give me a curt oops then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut next i told her i wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto so pretty pointy but on the shorter side as im watching her file my nails i have no idea what shes doing she finishes and theyre all oval after phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that i wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say thats not almond uh yes it is as she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch the whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it which hurt like a bitch which caused it to rip open again bleed more i barely even got an apology next was the colour fiasco upon arrival i had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails she paints the ring fingers first then when its time to move on the lilac she discovers that its dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting i grabbed my hand back and asked if i could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old which i already understood i just wanted to choose something totally different so she throws the chip wheel at me and says hurry up now i was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge she even pointed out how i was sweating well yeah im trying really hard to not have a freak out so i pick out my other colour a grey so she goes to retrieve it she comes back starts to paint my nail and its an orange colour i ask about it and she replies oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense yet again i ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time finally i pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied i almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but i just wanted to get the hell out of there so i settled up it cost about 20 more than the usual place i go this whole time i was perfectly polite and externally calm i even tipped her a little bit because as a server i know what its like to rely on tips i only went because this place had such good yelp reviews so i feel as if its my duty to save anyone else considering this place its worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails i know when things arent right as a bonus not even two weeks later i had a nail break off ridiculous
dicOVEe-9bPSEfqB1x-27A 5 excellent food and service very friendly servers would seriously recommend the tuna chips and soft buns
H1iP9Da8EjI29bhVr-j_dA 3 the desserts were ok the thing i doubted was they said they serve desserts with fresh fruit but my mango sago tasted like frozen mango its was sweet but i can tell from the texture of the mango that its frozen before

JRC8wpdCe35xRweZE7vQEw 3 good food and the manager there rocks she walked around and made it a point to talk to everyone the building however can get a little crowded but its a hotspot for gilbert so its to be expected overall its a cute place to take the family

6C0El0umFFoV6u3JUyg2Lw 5 what appeared to be a minor fender bender turned into a bit more i originally took my vehicle to the insurance company recommended collision experts and was told it would be 60000 figuring this was ridiculously low i took it to sudden where they concluded the damage was more extensive and proved it to the insurance company over 2000 they treated me how a customer should be with patience respect and excellent servicefrom taking me to the car rental company and waiting until i had the key in my hand to a excellent repair with a extra repair throw in at no charge
Arb3jd8Sn2OL7KR9kQ8FtQ 1 went with my daughter tonight and was refused due to her under the age of 21 both employees were very gracious in explaining the nv law and offered for us to wait in the foyer if we wanted something to go which we didnt a few other reviews mention the smoky atmosphere which it true but again not there fault since thats there decision on how they have licensed there business vegas could use a family friendly stieners because there food is consistently excellent on all my previous visits
IfgnHg6zQEbNGKYVcfYWtg 1 if you want a good margarita you will love this place and their guac live is really good tooi agree with the other the food needs some help but if you like margaritas and chips and salsa this is the place to go

ft4gj88irDqsY2y0Sow_2A 1 i have been going to the draft house for many years and have always enjoyed the food and the experience but lately the food hasnt been that good and the new staff in the dining room has alot to be desired  they were unattentive gave us the wrong check had to beg for a drink refill and were preoccupied with something else going onnot a good experiencevery disappointed

apeavIGMjBU2Db-V7tZwVg 5 had such a great experience at mens wearhouse when we walked in we were greeted by the manager who was very attentive and paid attention to what we were looking for he left us alone when we were browsing and helped when we were looking for sizes his name was jeffrey demoure and was great when he found out that my husband  was a police officer he very respectfully shook his hand and thanked him for his service when we cheeked out jeffery gave us a discount for my husbands service it was really sweet and we will absolutely go back again
yM9WN719mLif7itUtKG7rg 5 larry and akilah are wonderful to deal with they are professional and friendly when moving it became apparent that we were going to need an additional unit i called larry when the moving guys were just about done loading the truck i ran over there before the truck arrived larry had all the paperwork ready and i had lock and keys in hand as the truck arrived larry and akilah made a stressful situation much better
oCSkhKEcGyCTEloBlBo3RQ 5 i came here for lunch after reading previous reviews and now im hooked i come here at least twice a week now and love the salad and soup bar as well as the red curry delicious
wgpOyUNO9IC62E57vgX63Q 5 i was on a business trip in montreal and i made reservations for dinner 2 weeks prior this was my first visit to apdc and the place was just buzzing with energy and the sweet smell of pork order the bison tongue as an appy and it was outstanding  my friend had the seared foie gras and he kept rolling his eyes in delight the bottle of wine was a beautiful cote du  rhone quartz which paried very well with the meal  for main i had the maple pigs foot  the presentation is shocking the whole trotter in a cast iron pot with all the trimmings  the taste was insane  skin was sweet and crunchy while the meat was juicy and savory  the mash potato at the bottom soaked up all the essence from the dish very indulgent  brought 2 cans of duck in a can and flew them back to vancouver  split one can the next night with 4 senior citizens and they were very impressed  gave the other one to a friend and she had hers 2 days later and it was still amazing  verdict  these cans do travel so long as you keep them cold  they are good for at least 3 days  how do they stuff all the duck and foie gras with all the tirmmings in a small can
8bCuZoBHY5boMtRwA0k1bg 3 im from vancouver and have tasted all the ramen shops from kintaro to sanpachi  vancouver provides a wide array of ramen shops within a 1 mile radius within the downtown area  while on a business trip in toronto i went in kenzo for a late night bite and ordered the tonkotsu ramen  the noodles were cooked perfectly and the soup was steaming hot and had lots of death  it was every bit as good as the vancouver ramen shops  very impressed
T2R9o67SoI7W_7XkLoEiAQ 5 excellent he came to my place and detailed my yamaha r1 an my dirty super moto husky  he did such a great job the kind of work i thought only i would do with my own bikes  i usually do them but sometimes life gets busy its nice to know someone takes the time to do every little detail i do 100 happy and will use and recommend him over and over  a true ride so he gets it  thank you
D-dFWmzuOsRIcXQXuwSNRQ 1 terrible service period since we dont speak taiwanese people that showed up after us got seated before us they got their food before us the place is dirty we waited at our table for over 10 minutes before ever being acknowledged im pretty sure it would have been longer if we didnt go up to the cashier trying to order the table we had to run and claim ourselves the yelp location of the place is completely wrong so a couple of u turns had to happen waited forever for the food after waiting a lifetime to even put our order in while waiting watching more people who arrived after us get their food  the food is not worth going through all the crap   and the check was wrong
c44CQENmylT7PEa--xvrmg 5 this place is the bees knees and beyond the cats pajamas marlon the bartender is amazing and needs a raise asap and angela hubba hubba happy hour specials is hard to beat here and the yogurts soju is super yummy with good portions

yP03itb6yCIsc3GurmrG0g 5 kailin was the best waitress very attentive and quick for a party of 6 would highly recommend the kalbi beef with strawberry yogurt soju
PPvi5KebTX9WcDBFSlsrCQ 3 the food here is fresh and the coffee is delicately prepared thank god for ilys italian roast oliver is a very respectful host and super friendly every time i come here the service is friendly but a bit on the slow side since lunch is pretty busydefinitely try their eggplant and anything with pesto its delicious and the proportions are perfect for lunch the seafood bisque is rich and creamy if your feeling sweet try their monkey lattemy only peeve is that this place is a little awkward to get to and its tucked away on the side of a freeway and corporate offices
F501pCsl5da4YMgkxo-oug 1 beware  people at the store were helpful but they charged my card the minute my order was placed online on a weekend when they couldnt be reached by phone despite my explaining in the comments that i wanted to confirm the color before the order was completed  they did call to discuss the color and even sent photos to help me make a decision especially since shipping to california was very expensive  i got back to them  via email  that i appreciated their help which i did but that i was not going to complete the order and instead continue to look for a color closer to what i was after  i said that if i decided to go with the alternate they suggested different type of yarn and color i would get back to them but for now i wanted to keep looking  they responded by saying to let them know and how nice the other yarn was  two weeks later i get a message that theyve shipped yarn to me  i immediately contacted them saying i had canceled the order  that i had told them i was going to keep looking and had not accepted their suggestion but their response was that itd been two weeks so they automatically shipped  im guessing theyve sent the yarn i initially chose onlinei have no idea  they sent me no warning  no confirmation that they were going to shipand thats when i discovered theyd charged me for the order the minute it was placed  not when it was shipped like every other company ive done business with online  im extremely disappointed and will never do business with them again  beware if you give them any credit card info  theyll use it whether you want them to or not and the minute they have iteven when nothing has been settled or even shipped yet  to return it and pay shipping twice would cost more than the yarn so ive been forced to make this purchase even though they led me to believe i would not be
t3d3QRY09O4IMtZHGL0vmg 3 i have been eating here for years  while the ambiance is not great the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable  i have probably eaten every item on the menu lunch and dinner and never been disappointed i am a bit of a thai aficionado originally from ny  bangkok ocha is better than most  i have had better thai at significantly higher prices in florida and california  there are a couple of places in an atlanta that are as good but overall this is a terrific once a week at least spotwhile i understand reviews are subjective the details in some of these reviews what was ordered and the comments suggest input from thai posers and dabblers rather than addicts  i am the later
eOhwzJdx2jmT3KO-wHaViA 1 well another vacation ruined by frontier  what was a 2 hr delay turned into a 5 hr delay merry christmas   why dont u take better care of your planes so u dont disrupt the customers who actually fly your airline  as for me this is our last time

kpqNEkNVsn2_3BA5MFAATg 3 glorified mandarin totally not worth the money take any asian restaurant pile the food high put some fresh herbs on top and you have lee
Hv3coGSxnuKTMaAgpbJjjA 3 margarita was tasty food was decent but seriously who doesnt double stack their corn tortillas for tacos a single corn tortilla has zero structural integrity so im left forking my taco lame pun intended
YenGJQXh2ya7cbCbGqI-UA 5 smokeless joe gets 5 stars for being one of the greatest concept restaurants ive been inever  i completely understand and accept that my sense of smokeless joes greatness is directly attached to my own love love of a good pot of mussels  their african peanut soup is also great which makes me assume that the other stews and soups are too  additionally i find the beer list here suits my taste better than any other ive found in toronto so far and the fact that the beeristas are willing and required to leave their bar fortress and go to the fridge at the back of the store makes me feel grossly indulgent asking for some of their bottled speciailties  my one request for these guys is to find a way to add some pommes frites to the menubut ill be back weekly regardless
mAtuDgXXLeH6cxVJLjUFkg 3 the moules are great but the food and service dont quite add up to the pricesgood place to take a date if they are turned on my the fatness of your wallet
b235bNs57PpBcKZElyEbiw 3 i just like small bars betterok prices crap beers mixed crowd and ok music  this is the type of place i associate with cancun or tijuana more than torontos scene
oW-jzHg1uE8tfLkmb_Edig 3 i just moved to toronto and had to ship my bike across from the states  sweet petes was very helpful in receiving rebuilding and giving my bike a nice tuneup  i dont think ill be living near petes so i dont know how often i will go back but i very much appreciate their helping me make my move a bit easier and will certainly recommend them to others
lZRw4xT_X7m02fVgDK6nGQ 3 i had new ho king delivered  i did notdo notdo not plan to go to ut  those things said and understanding there may be some ambiancerelated pieces i am missing the food was not so good although delivery service in both depth of menu its like a road map of foodjust keeps on unfolding as well as open hours was impressive  i would not totally rule out ordering here againbut its going to have to be pretty late at night and probably a push between being conscious or passed out when the food arrives
T0Ir4bh86l3GSALxdJSbZw 5 as a hockey venue this is as good as it gets for a new arenathe joe is still the best for obvious reasons  on top of great seating there are huge beers to be had which reduces the impetus to leave ones seat and they also have a mean poutine or heart attack fries as i like to call them  great entertainment value all around
FbmbptfvejQtDwaHuHAjkA 3 so its not the most delicious pizza in the worldbut its super fresh super customizable super fast and super cheap  special right now gets a large pie 10 wings and 4 sodas for 22 after tax  which is insane  i say well worth the price
bC5EHqiKl8zkWt_rssH4Hg 3 got a new rack and panniers as well as some nice tires here and was happy with everythingwill definietely try service dept out this year
ngX9sChaU4L4lZs5wugqvA 3 i would give 3 starts but they carry my favorite hardtofind danish beer tuborg and that yields an extra star  the moules mussels are definitely worth the 4 stars as well but the large party read noncozy atmosphere just doesnt quite fit the menu  i think things here are a bit overpriced as well but when you look around and see 10000 sq ft of party space its easy to understand
xmq6DuRyKVEj5DlvrJvmIg 1 i had major bike issues on the don trail today and needed some tlc around 6pm  i rode past warren and they looked closedso i called  a very stoned sounding elderly lady answered saying helloooooo  so i asked if she was at warren cycle  yes  are you open  no  what kind of hours are they open if not 6pm on a weekday  not going to waste my time going here again
Dl_WVN_e6c04kAd5MXtk2A 5 first time eating at this restaurant and it was an excellent experience coming from the bay area we are seasoned pakiindo food eaters this food however is the best desi food we have ever tasted the best part was seeing my pre teen kids enjoying the food we ordered the wings chicken tikka masala chicken tandoori chicken boti i am coming again to phoenix just to eat here
IG6KlvSzTjfgvBSOEenphQ 5 the audi experience starts with the purchase  audi north scottsdale makes the buying and owning experience such a pleasure that you will probably always be an audi owner  the car speaks for itself as far as styling technologysafety  and luxury  the professionalism of every individual who works there inxluding steve bacca to jaime ossa to jason brown and anthony pacheco makes owning an audi a complete pleasure and a great experience  i am on my sixth audi
iHhLivLDbUhUCZ2Q7zZI6g 3 the food is  quite good and true to home style cooking  very friendly good service
T-oR1diaP-imXxCxJ6sTHA 1 i was disappointed this time  the service was great  the food however was certainly not what one would expect in the least from a restaurant of this calibre  my prime rib was tough and rubbery and so was the duck entree which my husband ordered  i had a solid experience last time around so maybe it was just a bad night
2YazjPNZPXaQqAS1sP0MGQ 3 four stars for the food here one star for the drinks  the food is delish favs include the kale  sweet potato wrap and the bbq chicken wrap  my issue is with the juices 1125 for fresh pressed pesticides  you cannot charge that much for a juice made with conventional non organic produce and position yourself as a health conscious restaurant catering to that clientele  people who can afford a 12 juice are smart enough to care where this guy sources his ingredients from  also worth noting that the meat is not organic either so the whole concept is a little off for me
xFY6Rs89XoY6fBmlcvm93Q 5 three words frozen hot chocolate  its epic  lives up to the hype  their desserts and food are geared toward tourists and nothing to write home about but its worth a trip for that hot chocolate which by the way you can get from the takeout window without having to sit down
N7WCcnQgXuYF_ITflWyhOA 5 todd englishs latest is incredible  great atmosphere cool bar outdoor pub tables red leather booths inside and our server paul was phenomenal  expansive bar and a huge selection of beers on tap including some very enticing samplers  no blue cheese olives for the martinis bummer since thats a signature drink at olives  prices are high as to be expected in city center  the seafood is the freshest ive had in all of vegas its flown in every morning  their live bar comes by the piece east and west coast oysters and delicious jumbo shrimp cocktail served on a gorgeous platter over ice and garnished with sea plants  the duck buns were incredible the meat was sweet and tender and the buns were like soft little pillows  ive been dreaming about these ever since and i plan to come back for them  lobster rolls were delicious sweet rolls lightly buttered and grilled then stuffed with lots of sauteed lobster meat  the coleslaw they were served with was the best ive had  the moules frites mussels came in a rich delicious curry broth and even the fries were perfect  we also had the pickles three housemade varieties thought they came with bottled mustard and not stone ground  the smoked salmon quesadilla was incredible with buttered yukon golds and fried capers  they also do a fabulous bread pudding that is served with fresh whipped cream salted caramel ice cream and a delicious toffee sauce  the bread pudding itself was the perfect texture and is one of my favorite desserts in all of vegas  this place rules i cant wait to come back and try the carvery menu chose your meat sauces and bread  definitely recommended
BNTyVDQ1rm0AFdv0da0Trg 5 best donuts ever  seriously theyre amazing  huge selection of every variety imaginable if you come early  favs are the apple fritters they let you chose from lighter or darker ones depending on how done you like them and their old fashioned buttermilk  the donuts on the top two rows of the case are vegan  but youd never know it  their chocolate glazed cream filled soymilk and glazed raspberry jelly gelatinfree are crazy good  i dream of these things  holeinthewall smack dab in chinatown  the owner  her husband are as sweet as can be  i only wish they were open 24 hours
itC-MHiVQ9uch8ZqAouPCQ 5 love love love sambalatte  vegas has been lacking cafes like this one i go here multiple times a week and everything has been perfect  they have many different coffees brewed through various unique processes that make a french press look run of the mill  cappuccinos and lattes are full bodied and strong and they have designs in the foam  great hot tea selection available in french press pots and a delicious iced green yerba mate  they have sandwiches good caprese one heated and served with a side of balsamic and lots of desserts including minis napoleon eclair tiramisu cups etc  they also have gelato and sorbet and my husbands all time fav affogato gelato with a shot of espresso poured over  the atmosphere here is charming and warm and they are open till 10pm wedsat  service is excellent they always walk upstairs to bring me my drink and are super friendly  there is free wifi and an entire long table downstairs with multiple plugs for laptops  only negative is that i wish they stayed open later on weekends especially for vegas 10pm is early to close
47r814oPnytzHzdPCt_IAA 1 marche bacchus has a gorgeous view but the food does not stand up as is often the case  the quality was average at best  the lobster croissant that everyone raves about was terrible a stale croissant unnecessarily toasted and filled with lobster meat that tasted fake  it was shredded and almost had the texture of krab  very unappealing and a very poor rendition of a lobster sandwich  the signature bread pudding was also subpar burnt on top and dry throughout  definitely not worth the preordering and 20 minute wait   service is disappointing however the wine store is lovely and has a nice selection at reasonable prices  the view is great and they have misters major bonus in summer time but next time i will be trying garfields next door in hopes of a better meal
wb6zJ5h5oyycgL8NLrVEBw 3 great pet boutique  they carry all the hollistic brand foods including the standard wellness formula and the grain free variety  they have a great selection of treats both bagged variety and behind their bakery counter  they also have a nice selection of toys harnesses clothes and bath products  i love this store prices are reasonable and staff are always friendly and knowledgable  highly recommended for anyone who feeds their dogcat healthy food and treats
E7vDhV3f9_Ve4h7GSO5v4g 3 i am updating my review of luvit still the best frozen custard in vegas by a mile  however it is super lame that they use styrofoam cups in this day and age  polystyrene is not accepted by recycling waste mgmt in las vegas its a possible carcinogen its made with petroleum it is clogging our landfills etc google it  with so many eateries going green and switching to ecofriendly packaging i wish luvit would too  this guy sells a ton of custard every day and i cant imagine how many of these cups he goes through  you gotta get with the times
OWt9XHjSAvqHNcoCDvFiMQ 3 mad love for the slider truck  what a great concept i am so glad this place is getting the attention it deserves  finally we have a gourmet mobile restaurant  the weekly schedule is posted on their website wwwslidinthrucom and on twitter  my fav is the caprese grilled eggplant mozarella toms basil balsamic  they also have a pulled pork slider a beef one with tzatziki and feta a bbq one with carmelized jalapenos and a classic with cheddar bacon and special sauce  supposedly they are going to start doing a chicken one too fantastic news for me and my husband since we dont eat red meat  their buns are great and everything has a really nice smokey flavor from the grill  they have regular fries and really good sweet potato fries tossed in cinnamon and sugar  only thing i wish they had is unsweetened iced tea and i am looking forward to more chicken and fish specials  prices are reasonable ingredients are high quality and these guys especially ric are total chillers  there is always a line and your sliders are made to order so be prepared to wait a couple minutes   if you havent been here be sure to check it out  i cannot give this place enough praise mad props for a guy in his 20s acting on a really great idea vegas so needed this
azIy8Ua2fV3-n7NRw3wv8Q 1 mad hatter cupcakes are not good  i have tried every cupcake bakery in vegas and these rate at the bottom  they use oil and poor quality ingredients and their cupcakes look very unrefined almost unappetizing  this would be a cute place for a cheesy kids birthday party because you can customize your own cupcake cake filling frosting and topping  unfortunately their cakes are tasteless and the frosting is overly sweet  these dont hold a candle to the cupcakery sprinkles or any other decent joint
eOCdS3327PEwWLYhH6-vgg 5 olives is a fantastic restaurant exactly what youd expect from todd english  the flavors are somewhat mediteranean and theyve got a great menu  their cocktails are fabulous i love their white peach belini and my husband is crazy about their dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives  the bread basked comes with fresh baked onion foccacia and two kinds of olive tapenade  they have some really good apps including a great ahi tartare and some really nice flatbreads one with proscuitto and figs another with mushrooms and a great classic tomatobasilmozarella  favs on the dinner menu include the scallops perfectly seared served with risotto the butternut squash tortellini and the chestnut ravioli served on a bed of creamed spinachheavenly  do not skip dessert here they have a souflee that is crazy good  flavors change but the strawberry is incredible so is the vanilla  my husband and i order two thats how delicious they are  service here is always great very attentive  i recommend sitting on the patio its much more private and has a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains and water show  definitely make reservations or you could be waiting 2 hours for a table
Hu4-DKakumqEqlAG1yGD6w 3 great coffee shop in the henderson part of town  they have really good iced tea avaiable in 3 flavors including unsweetened peach black tea and passion berry amazing  their coffee is fair trade organic and varies daily  they have a small selection of pastries and some breakfast and lunch options vegan friendly  they have a good breakfast burrito with eggs potatoes beans cheese fresh avocado and lots of spinach  there are comfy seats and a bookcase full of books however they are only open till 8pm  awesome eclectic staff super friendly and knowledgeable about their coffees  i wish they had a largerbetter pastry selection and were open later  we need a place in vegas that is comparable to the living room in sd and this is the closest i have found so far  i so wish theyd open one in the summerlinish area
Qy2hvB_xQ0dFUYYZA7la4Q 3 original pancake is one of the best breakfast places ever  they are a chain and their locations in rancho santa fe sd palm desert chicago etc are all way more charming than this one  that said breakfast here is always consistently delicious and the service is great  their omelettes are fluffy and baked with the ingredients inside almost like a souflee  they do a great dutch baby german apple pancake and a dutch garden dutch baby topped with veggies and cheese  their pancakes are my favorite thin and flavorful you can smell the buttermilk  they come in every flavor including seasonal pumpkin amazing and fresh strawberry with whipped cream during summer months with fresh not canned whipped cream  they also have classics like eggs benedict corned beef hash and amazing swedish pancakes thin like crepes  they also have a location in gvr that is newly expanded for people on the henderson side of town
nb4Lxuxc0Ciq4YbpJni3Cg 3 hugos is a vegas landmark and an old school experience not to be missed  let me be perfectly clear that it is in the four queens hotel a dive hotel on the old strip with the parking lot to match  that said when you step down the stairs into hugos cellar you are in an entirely different environment  ladies are greeted with a rose and the setting is very romantic dark wood walls candlelight  service is excellent and they have some great sommeliers  they have a very good wine list and serve complementary bottled water as well as a nice bread basket with cheesetoasted lavash and roseshaped butter  their salads are the highlite included with your meal and freshly prepared on a cart at your table  toppings like hearts of palm and bay shrimp and delicious dressings try the orange walnut vinaigrette  you are served an intermezzo sorbet to cleanse the palatte raspberry on a mini cone  dinner is very traditional chicken fish and steaks served with a potato and vegetable  not especially gourmet or cutting edge but very old school classic and part of the experience  they offer traditional desserts such as bananas foster prepared tableside and they bring a complementary dessert of chocolate covered strawberries dried figs and apricots served with whipped cream  this restaurant is great and remeniscent of old vegas definitely a must try
vwmo-62vWfCKnR97895Opw 3 this place is super clean major bonus points and they have great vegetarian pho  i am mostly restaurant vegetarian and its hard to find pho that is not either a beef or chicken broth  theirs i think called tofuvegetable is very flavorful salty and comes with a platter of very fresh veggies to arrange in your soup as you like  my husband and i each get a large bowl it is huge and takes forever to eat  their fresh spring rolls the cold ones are good but not the best ive had  the sweet sauce that comes with them is great  major bonus points for a place that offers a veg pho on par with the traditional beef one
rUoMvoXxdqTCxCmIL2CrpQ 3 glaziers is pretty middle of the road for me let me start off by saying that the store has a very strong strange odor that has lingered since they first opened my husband says its tolerable i find it hard to bear the layout is nice and the store looks impressive compared to most regular grocery stores smiths vons etc they have a large produce selection at very affordable prices lots of exotic fruit vegetables and peppers that cannot be found at conventional grocers however their herbs and most greens are less than fresh and their selection of organic produce is lacking and way too expensive when compared to trader joes whole foods or even vons they have a great selection of ready made food but few healthy options pizza ice cream sushi pasta salads pasta entrees vegetable and starch sides etc some of what ive tried has been good including salmon stuffed with spinach and pesto green beans almondine mixed vegetable rice broccoli with peppers etc they also have a nice looking coffee and tea bar and a good selection of gourmet bread la brea bakery olive bread jalapeno cheddar pain rustic organic whole grain etc they have a huge bakery with donuts pastries pies and cakes at shockingly low prices but nothing even remotely health conscious salad bar is run of the mill and cant hold a candle to whole foods but again the prices here are incredibly reasonable they do have an organicnatural food section but they do not have organic eggs meat etc i could not do my regular grocery shopping here but this place is great for specialty items and anyone shopping on a budget it is far better than a walmart or smart and final and i like the fact that its family owned their produce selection is worth a trip alone i also find myself coming here when i get home late and dont want to cook their ready made and prepackaged food is available till they close at midnight i wish theyd offer reusable bags a discount card and a juice bar among their ready made food stations i also wish theyd refresh their magazines i feel like i am in the twilight zone when i stand in line and see covers from weeks ago
gx3y9GCoW8HjHomYvj0cbg 5 this place is fab they have every single toy imaginable from the typical pet store brands to more boutique style gamebrain teaser toys my dogs are currently obsessed w hideasquirrel  they also have food treats leashes harnesses and more all discounted  love this place
j95JQtJde3A7rm_Y3HHZmQ 3 this is one of the best places for boba tea in the city  they have an extensive menu featuring the usual flavored black and green teas slushes snow ices and smoothies  their prices are more reasonable than most tea houses in chinatown the service is friendly and the place is clean as can be  there are always people getting takeout drinks here and there are a couple tables inside and out front  favs include the strawberry milk tea and passion fruit black tea both with boba  my husband loves their fruit slushes
76KcHohecAR10T2l04YGqg 1 pet pros is a nightmare i cannot emphasize this enough  their dogs come from puppy mills they were taken from their mothers far too soon and many dogs in the store have kennel cough and other illnesses due to improper care  the staff as expected tell you the dogs came from reputable breeders and have papers which means nothing and is standard in this industry  this is where people go to purchase designer dogs for astronomic prices without doing the research or investigating this industry  a simple search on google will tell you all you need to know about petstores puppy mills and the store itself  go to petfindercom and search for a rescue dog that fits your needs or check out local animal shelters  if you are looking for a specific hypoallergenic dog check out breedspecific rescue organizations ie poodle rescue  dont breed or buy while shelter pets die
zmVpf7r00n7zNvZ-htWvVg 5 tommy bahamas is great  i have eaten at their restaurants in maui palm desert and here in vegas they are all consistently fabulous  service is always attentive and they have a great happy hour in the bar there are also comfy booths if you dont want to sit at the actual bar  happy hour is i think from 47pm weekdays discounted apps and drinks and some really good fish tacos  their bread is in the shape of a crown served hot with a sweet cinammon butter  great apps favs include the coconut shrimp cayman lollipops chicken drumettes with mango bbq sauce goat cheese with mango salsa and flatbread and the ahi poke  at lunch they have really nice salads and some great sandwiches including a beerbattered crispy fish sandwich with tarter sauce and honey roasted onions  for dinner they have great seafood and a really great stuffed chicken herb cheese and roasted red pepper cream  dessert here is a must the pina colada cake is good but the butterscotch pudding is incredible  most desserts are available in small sizes though they dont display this on the menu so youll have to ask  i highly recommend this place especially for dinner on the patio on warm summer nights
duvPONn-Lv2sK8m7nCqm_Q 3 tea station is my favorite place for boba tea in chinatown  their prices are definitely higher than most of the competition but they do offer a discount on all togo drinks  and lets be real some of the other tea houses in the area are just plain creepy  the menu is extensive over 10 pages of tea and the atmosphere is nice  this place is very clean major bonus points especially if youve frequented some of their local competition  tea station is always packed especially at night since they are open late  my favs are their passion fruit green tea with boba or the iced mixed fruit tea although this one is super sweet  my husband likes their fruit slushes  this is a great place to get work done during the day free wifi or meet friends at night  it is very popular for takeout drinks in fact i always see 50 popping in here for their late night boba fix  service is reasonably friendly but definitely on the slow side especially during busy times  i would not recommend the food their squid balls were inedible and smelled like a mixture of hot garbage and the ocean though perhaps they are an acquired taste  i recommend this place based on their atmosphere tea and the fact that they are open late  this is definitely more of a traditional tea house than your average takeout boba shop
a5IHhvqpCPsYea-ES6nXuw 3 layers is the best bakery in vegas without question  this place is the closest thing vegas has to a high quality bakery on par with sf or la  they use high quality ingredients and everything is always fresh never sitting out more than that same day like other lame bakeries in the area  favs include their butter bars cupcakes flavors change daily and sticky buns get there early these go super fast  they also do beautiful celebration cakes to order and have some avaiable in store every day  i only wish they had more french pastries almond croissants napoleans eclairs brioche etc  that would bump them up to 5 star status
-3GgVv9pFnYmK875TCpHlA 3 dupars is all about the pancakes go here for them theyre incredible  fluffy drizzled with butter  served up 247  solid breakfast here bruleed oatmeal w fresh fruit  eggs florentine among my favs  they also have a great tuna melt split pea soup carved turkey sandwiches pies etc  this is my goto spot after a late night downtown and for breakfast when im willing to make the trek down to freemont  everyone ive taken here loves this place they have an expansive menu and those pancakes are the absolute bomb  best in vegas maybe even the best ever
rnrbXssf9gu540kcSMq67g 3 vivido gelato is good but not authentic italian gelato  large selection of flavors but theyre lacking some traditional staples straciatella fior de latte etc and need more fruit options  prices are high especially given the small servings two small gelatos for 8  also they limit you to two flavor samples per person which they announce when you walk in  this just seems really cheap of them and totally rubbed me the wrong way  there is something in their gelato that makes it very stretchy almost gummy  the mint was pretty good but colored with green dye blood orange was okay but not very flavorful  i will probably go back if i crave gelato again but only because there is nowhere else in the area
5_bs_GYNIUrRAeDCutDiVg 5 this is the best dog store in vegas  the selection cannot be beat they carry all the hollistic dry and wet foods as well as treats  great selection of wellness formula which is what i feed my dogs  they also have a huge variety of toys chews clothes beds leashes harnesses bath products etc  they will special order anything you want that is not instore  unfortunately i live clear across town from this store or i would shop here far more often  as far as pet stores in vegas this is as good as it gets
UsS8p8xwZcMfcL8ba2hT1g 3 hedarys is legit lebanese food  really yummy mango juice more like a nectar and not overly sweet  solid hummus good tabouli and greek salads and an incredible lentil soup  falafel are flavorful and not overly fried although the sandwich was a bit on the dry side needed more veggiessauce to balance out the grittiness of the falafel balls  pita bread alone is worth the visit here sweet puffy and served hot out of the oven  i definitely want to come back for their lunch specials and to try the shrimp scampi ordered by the table next to us smelled and looked amazing  hummus pita  that lentil soup are better here than anywhere else in the valley
OM3jdzNpoHEGCaQZ4UsjAw 5 this is the premier alpaca store in the valley if youre into this sort of thing  i happen to love various furs from mongolian lamb to sheepskin to alpaca and this store is a fur heaven  i take trips out here with friends when we want to update or add to our collections  i love that no animals are killed for this fur and the quality is exceptional  they have fab pillows rugs and various accents for the home as well as some pretty cute sweaters  ive also gotten some handmade moccasins and a horseshoe hook here designed by a local artist in boulder city  prices are on the high side which is typical for alpaca but the men that work here owners im guessing have been accommodating at lowering the price especially when you buy several items  if youre looking for alpaca this is the place to go
lZoqIs5Td0dUA_DW4V7wFA 3 im a fan of rachels  like another yelper said vegas needs way more places like this  its a gourmet little breakfast and lunch spot you order at the counter and there are some cute tables in and outside  they have breakfast burritos pancakes sandwiches wraps burgers beef chicken soups pastas and huge salads spinach curry chicken cobb  there is a nice selection of veg options and everything is fresh and high quality  pastries could be much improved on and i wish they served breakfast past 11 on weekends  mad props for having fresh brewed tropical unsweetened iced tea
0FlTdE0Cqc7ujLNTzYpOMw 3 earl of sandwich is a great concept and the menu is super enticing  prices are fair quality is average  the turkey is in the form of cold cuts not roasted like capriottis and mirrored the quality of a quiznos or worse yet subway  the bread here is baked fresh to order and is fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside yum  the all american sandwich was okay but again the quality of the turkey was off putting  it had cranberry sauce buttermilk ranch lettuce tomatoes and cheddar  the fellow reviewer who said this sandwich trumps the bobbie must have had a few too many i mean really  the tuna melt however was great very simple with just tuna salad and melted cheese but delicious  if you like tuna melts then this is the place for you that might have been a 5star sandwich  potato salad was average and they have a selection of other salads and kettle chips  there is also an assortment of baked goods unfortunately the chocolate cupcake we tried was yellow cake mix with chocolate frosting lame  the earl gray lemonade was refreshing and delicious and i loved that it was something different  major props for having good vegetarian options veggie sandwich with feta and peppers and a caprese  id probably come back for the tuna melt and an earl gray lemonade but i am shocked that this place has better ratings than the much superior tom colicchio brainchild witchcraft which uses vastly superior ingredients and has more exciting offerings  mad props that its open 24 hours
VQR9u5gWigPQqttg12zo-A 5 sababa has moved up to five star status strictly based on their falafel  let me be perfectly clear i have never had anything else here  however this is the best falafel in vegas and i have tried many  the falafel and hummus comes in a pita pocket filled with tahini tomatoes pickles cabbage cucumbers and lettuce  they have an incredible green parsley hot sauce crazy hot and their falafel is moist all the way through not dry in the center like many others  the falafels are fried to order and the sandwich is made in front of you  still wish they had fresh brewed iced tea but i usually get takeout anyway  this place is israeli owned and about as authentic as it gets
8g3N6sHKf89MwS6znhqraQ 3 i love red velvet cafe for their baked goods alone  i have never eaten the food here but have visited many times for tea and cake and often pick up their baked goods to bring home  the owners wife does all the baking herself and it is clear that great care has gone into developing her recipes  my favorite is the red velvet cake which looks like a large cupcake and is topped with a deliciously sweet frosting and a whole strawberry   they also do a delicious chocolate peanut butter cake also in the shape of a large cupcake with a moist chocolate cake and rich peanut butter frosting  the best part about these cakes is that they are under 200 calories vegan and free of any saturated or trans fats  she does not use artificial sweeteners or make things that are low fat but still unhealthy these cakes are all natural preservative free and taste delicious  i highly recommend this place for their baked goods alone and i look forward to trying their food  the menu features sandwiches pastas salads and an assortment of vegan meats and cheeses that are all made on site
zyXCUPpiotXHwuaQHR--cw 3 went back to fresh 52 today with the desperate hope that theyd expanded and added a few more vendors  unfortunately you can literally walk through the entire place in under 5 mins so its hardly worth the drive across town  however there are a couple places that will keep me coming back at least on occasion  the bread from bon breads is solid and they have lots of varieties white chocolate batard multigrain pretzel rolls ciabatta etc  also the salsa and chutneys from miguels rock  the salsas all have a great kick and they have a mango one too  they have jalapeno jellies and an amazing apricot jalapeno chutney that is super flavorful  a couple places have come in since summer and a couple have gone out there is still a decent sized produce stand but its strange that there was only the one vendor  there is a face painting station a dog store and a booth that sells scentsy  there is also an organic loose leaf tea stand and another with baked goods although there were very few options  there is a crepe stand too but they were mostly dessert flavors rather than breakfast options  i wish this place was 10 times the size it is but its still worth checking out and most of the vendors were solid
7BjS2cOrQXEIPpAKXBLvuw 3 this review is for the spa only  its a fab property that ive enjoyed coming to for years unfortunately this place is pretty dead lately and the staff are not friendly  my masseuses have all been good but nail techs not so much  if they are struggling for clients they need to up the ante and make it a great experience worth the drive  also the pool was closed due to it being a weekday so we couldnt use the full spa amenities which is why we go
a0SUOGOGA38TVe-xiTUDWw 3 benjrong is a great neighborhood thai place my husband and i have been getting takeout from here on a weekly basis since they opened and have never been disappointed  the service is excellent and the restaurant could not be cleaner or more pristine the entire kitchen is on display major bonus  favs include their vegetable egg rolls love that sweet clear chili sauce tom yum soup pad see ew pineapple fried rice pad thai and the currys  their hot sauce is great so are the lunch specials  the food does not compare to los or komol in terms of the flavor or complexity but everything ive had has always been fresh and delicious  i definitely recommend this spot it is way above average for a local thai place and is not filthy dingy poor quality or lacking flavor like so many other local places
JquBPoTv8E9B0PImoxX72Q 5 five stars for the falafel at amena  similar in style to the falafel in pita at sababa hummus cabbage pickles tomatoes etc but even better  their pita is fluffy  delicious like soft little pillows  falafel are bright green flavorful and the perfect size  you order at the counter and when its ready you come up and chose what veggies you want inside  they also have a good homemade hot sauce on the tables and a great selection of bakery items including a really great baklava  best falafel in pita ive had in vegas  i wish id tried this place sooner the creepy trader joes strip malldivey location was throwing me off  i should have trusted mistys review because ive been missing out  and like she said they sell their pita bread
jQIvBD-o4wux2r64D53h9Q 3 familia is in a strip mall on durango and delivers to the surrounding area super fast  good service  they always get your order right  love their garlic knots greek salad and pizzas cheese w ricotta  basil is our standby  they also have calzones and stromboli  good cannolis thick cream with cinnamon and chocolate chips filled to order in their homemade shells  spumoni ice cream for sale by the tub  way better than marcos or some of the other chains in the vicinity
Rr7DUgBcjzKGQ3KiONi-7A 3 love this sushi spot ive been coming here for the past few years  theyre in town square across the street from hm next to yogurtland  atmosphere is warm and trendy and is why i often prefer kabuki to other places in the area  comfy private booths tables sushi bar and an outdoor patio  usually crowded from happy hour great specials to closing but ive never had to wait more than 1015 mins  extensive cocktail menu decent wine selection and several flavored nonalcoholic drinks including sweet mango iced tea and mint lemonade  edamame comes with all sushi orders  good miso soup and house salad with ginger dressing decent seaweed salad but not my fav  lots of apps including fried eggplant and calamari  large selection of specialty sushi rolls fav is the lotus on fire roll spicy tuna jalapeno and lotus root on california rolls  extensive menu with lots of pictures and lots of nonsushi items including teriyaki noodle dishes soups seafood etc  fresh fish great service  atmosphere
IMuAGbZQDet04ZUbKMNJaA 5 settebello is definitely the best italian pizza ive had outside of italy  their crust is bubbly chewy and delicious  they have some nice salads and a yummy focaccia this is really just their pizza crust baked with some oregano and sea salt but delicious none the less  great sangria coctails and espresso  unfortunately their iced and hot teas are lipton lame  the margherita pizza is delicious as is the four cheese with gorgonzola and ricotta yum  their cannolis are good traditional with dried fruit and chocolate chips but the shells and cream were both a little thick  their gelato is also good but very airy and not dense like traditional gelato great flavors though including a seasonal apricot  comfortable atmosphere with tables and booths props and well worth the drive across town  five stars based on their pizza alone delicious
uvYEVAqZYIrfcSk6VHrZoA 5 5 stars for the chai latte at tipsy best chai ive found in vegas  spicy and not overly sweet and major bonus points for being able to order it with almond or soy milk  the chocolates here are also great the smores bar is graham crackery peanut buttery amazingness  definitely a spot worth checking out
rMxsO1121Ki9O2NfDOQYEw 5 lucilles is really great bbq definitely the best in vegas by far theyre located in the district in gvr and the atmosphere is really great very southern expect an insane wait here on weekends but its well worth it they have some of the best sweet tea ive had served in a huge maison jar the bread basket is stuffed with buttermilk biscuits and apple butter and they have some really good apps like pulled chicken sliders on sweet rolls fried green tomatoes with red pepper cream and fried pickles spears not chips served with remoulade they have delicious salads one with sauteed shrimp one with smoked salmon and a peach vinaigrette one with bbq chicken and onion strings they have the usual meat platters with brisket tri tip ribs chicken etc they have a good blackened catfish and some incredible sandwiches my favorite is the bbq chicken sandwich with melted cheddar onion straws and lots of field greens on a french roll they also have yummy potato buns sides are awesome good mac n cheese peanut slaw sweet potato fries cheese grits etc  mad props for being one of the few bbq joints that also caters to vegetarians veggie burger salad or a really good marinated portobello sandwich with melted cheese and garlic mayo desserts include fruit cobbler pecan pie peach bread pudding banana pudding and red velvet cake  there is a separate take out area near the entrance that absolutely kills it service is great and prices are reasonable especially given the huge portions and quality this is the only place my husband and i go when we crave bbq and we often take out of town guests here for the great atmosphere and food
2AYM2avwxiTBxMXntkpZMw 3 i bought my car here late last year and have had good experiences with both their sales and service staff  they are knowledgeable about all the models including mine which was new for 2010 and they do not leave harassing messages or turn into stalkers if you need some time to think before making your lease purchase  they always loan me a lexus rental during servicing even if i did not reserve one in advance  the waiting room here is about as nice as one could be flat screen comfy couches drinks bagelscookies my husband creeps on their cookies like theyre going out of style  thorough car wash inside and out with every service  when an update was needed for my cars computer system they came to my house and installed it  unfortunately they are the only lexus dealer in the entire valley so they arent exactly wheelin  dealin here  i hear they are opening another location in the henderson area which im sure will be a huge plus for people on the other side of town
jQARtVDXq-A9Lfvmg_rYHA 3 the molto vegas farmers market is one of my favorite things to do in this city  this is an indoor famers market located on dean martin in a warehouse  it runs on thursdays from 11am1pm with a previewing for chefs at 10am  i found out about this place by eating at one of batalis restaurants its all through word of mouth they dont advertise  there is lots of fresh produce including some nice heirloom tomatoes herbs lettuce interesting citrus etc though it is not all organic  their prices are high as to be expected  they do not carry dairy for sale to the public aside from cheeses sometimes goat gouda and a heavenly buratta that sells out immediately  you have to be a member of their profit sharing group to purchase the eggs  there are a couple other vendors that sell coffee dates and some hydroponicly grown herbs  this market is very small and even mediocre compared to what you would find in california or seattle but it is much better than the other farmers markets here in vegas  be sure to bring your reusable bag
CXm-RCYt0sp01Hasp-PVmg 5 the only company in town to use for anything water heater related  had my water heater replaced for 650 other companies quoted between 8001k  charlie and shane were awesome straightforward on time  super honest  highly recommend
8IJTnD7lMPklq8LOIVkUKw 5 love the cheap flights plane was clean and attendants was really niceeveryone complains about additional charges but if you read the fine prints and understand their policy then youll have absolutely no problem
C9Qh8PWsfJNg2n6mEflHyA 3 went there for my husbands birthday on 1216 and the food was not as good as the first time we went in january 2014  the soup was cold the shitake mushroon side taste like soy sauced mushrooms and the american cap was flavorful but was tough 5 star is for the american kobe mac and cheese and the french press coffee yumo  we really like the service and hope the next time we go to vegas the food will be as good as the first time
X8YDHpMp6S1rfarcuaPbZQ 3 we stopped by for pho since we were soo done with the vegas mass grazing from last night  the pho here is decent as far as vegas goes and the broth doesnt taste artificially sweet like some places when they load the msg in there their bean sprouts are super clean and white which is a good indication they do it right we may come back again if we have a pho craving while in vegas oh dont order the che ba mau dessert it is a rip off
498PnbjX_IdBdjIVnegeJg 3 the roast pork was crispy and is better than sam woo the bbq pork noodle was okay because the bbq pork wasnt great the food is definitely made for asian taste and thus authentic  if you like sweet and sour then this aint the placetry panda express portions are huge so be ready to share
_YKZDcsZ34XzabQJXmIm-Q 1 i am from la where there are many sam woos and this ones got to be the worst you would think being the only one in vegas it would do a better job at living up to the name like its la restaurants instead they take a monopoly attitude food is mediocre and portions half of the same order in la places we tried the roast duck and you can tell it wasnt done thoroughly trhough and the meat didnt marinate through long enough we also tried the clam and ginger scallions clams were not fresh and the sauce had too much corn starch that it was thick and startchyalso dont ask for forks or spoons as they still had clumps of someone elses dinner still stuck on themstay with the disposable bamboo chopsticks
1DPL8zmhG0ERfhjAArbG7Q 1 avoid the worst customer service i have experienced in las vegas extremely hard to cancel account i was told my account was closed and current then was still billed after i moved when they claimed i still have bottles that were not dropped off long wait times for customer support if there are other options use them trust me you are better off getting a faucet water filter
4qujfz7p5-zjW4Cp4ujMLA 5 great customer service from linda first affogato and it was great we tried the strawberry and cheesecake gelato its all delizioso
eJblydKi2ZVUQx9YRgTYTA 5 the reasons i choose this place over chipotle wheat tortilla brown rice option pesto cilantro sauce no charge for guacamole on items i go here probably 2 times a week lately because it is a good option for a healthy meal i usually get the salad with brown rice black beans chicken pesto sauce and salsa i also like the option for a wheat tortilla guacamole is fresh and has always been good great food great healthy options good service
OMGU0QF9EJzIxLHGg-Aaew 5 some of the most authentic bbq ive had in vegas to date brisket was by far the best item on the menu they know what they are doing bbq is a tough sell in las vegas and i hope they stay put for a long time well done
5BcuwzmlplsDp2fiqGRHdA 1 i was a customer for 6 years always paid my bill on time i go to cancel my account a month before i move and i was told to bring all bottles and dispenser in before march 1st i returned all bottles and dispenser on feb 23rd i was given a receipt that said my account was closed and current today i get a bill for 30 and they say i have 5 bottles to return still are you kidding me you looked at my account on feb 23 and cleared it took 30mins on hold to get customer service and was just told that she sent an email and a response would take 3 days if they determine i somehow have these mystery bottles of water that i never received i will not be refunded avoid this service trust me everything about closing the account was and still is a nightmare do yourself a favor and do business with someone else some of the worst customer service i have seen in las vegas to date shame of businesses that know they are below standards and continue to operate without making changes to provide better service i hope all the negative reviews catch up to you and you see a decline in your profits because i am guessing that is the only way you will fix the issues
JR-GQhf8TqpdipWZN-5fHQ 1 let me preface this review by stating some facts i lived here for 6 years we always paid rent on time were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants these apartments were great 5 years ago what happened if you are debating renting here let me fill you in on what you are really in for 2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners that was the downfall instead of taking care of upgrading appliances upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal they chose to close down the main pool right before summer the pool was closed for months they offered no reimbursement whatsoever when you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments the mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot car patrolled security nonarmed that once existed must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye apartment building security lights were left burned out even after many maintenance requests which was clearly a security issue this last december there was an armed robbery at the mailbox at 10pm two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant we no longer felt safe and it was in my opinion because of poor management with caring about the safety and wellbeing of its tenants that were already moved inonce youre in why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety you signed a lease and they know they have you locked in in the last 2 years our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times the first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error as stated by the maintenance man and was repaired very poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldnt use our main bathroom the third time see video and pictures was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced the managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years they also never came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled the foundation for the apartment is shifting as well there were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the buildings unrepaired structure multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this nothing was fixed just noted on our maintenance record sounds great right theres more so you can see how unprofessional they are but how about unethical they started bribing tenants to put in 5 star reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for ipods and other prizes they also recently started asking new tenants to put in 5 star reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs if you ran a sound business with great satisfaction you wouldnt need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews would you shame on any business that does this and last but not least we are at the time of writing this review 41516 still waiting for our security deposit like i said we always paid rent on time for 6 years and the one time we are legally due our deposit in full within 30 days of moving out nevada states law nrs 118a242 it has not arrived we have called jessi the manager multiple times and never received a call back from her we received one email stating the refund has been processed but still no update on the status or postage datethey tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what you are a business act like it dont make excuses just fix issues if i were to tell them 2 years ago that i had some personal problems and couldnt pay rent which never happened just example given would they let me pay late or maybe within 710 business days no they would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didnt receive payment these are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there it is not right that businesses dont care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked we should have moved out 2 years ago that was our fault for staying so long but we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff 24hr armed security car patrol maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day all for the same price we paid there do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself i can tell you that we feel like andy dufresne in shawshank redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free good riddance vintage at the lakes and no you cant buy a 5 star review from me
UjUbobbR2Takr5_GEhnWvg 3 cool little breakfast spot staff was really great nice atmosphere and country decor we had the red velvet pancakes and the monte cristo they were insanely good if you arent watching the calories go and try these they also have a good selection of items for you if you are eating very healthy too as i look forward to heading back there and trying the lighter options as well a

76-blx-l94yFJf7VIoPgxw 1 horriblewe got a late night dinner there and everything was horrible first it looked like it was closed i am sure that the employees do this so people just drive away i wish we did our order was wrong cold and super greasy fries and the chicken sandwich was raw if you think its a pain to cook chicken late at night because it takes awhile say you are all out but never rush itthis place needs to either be under new management or torn down start over with a place that gives a damn
lUX1oD-UK8E0pCuic57EyA 5 i have been only volunteering at toys 4 smiles for a few weeks now but i can definitely say this is a great group of individuals that are donating a lot of time and energy to do something simple yet profound make children happy in a society full of highspeed entertainment internet cell phones and video games fueled by a i want it yesterday mentality it is refreshing to see something like toys 4 smiles these toys are very simple yet very high quality it is rare in this day and age that a child will receive a toy that not only was handmade for them but also requires them to use their imaginations the way i think of it is that maybe some of these kids getting theses toys dont have a lot of people in their lives that make them seem worth it well i am hoping that some of these kids will get these toys and understand that a stranger took the time to make them by hand and that a stranger cares they are worthy of it and deserve it its a simple thing but if that message reaches some children that message could possibly affect a life i encourage anyone looking to donate some time doesnt matter how much to give them a call and head on in and help make some toys
R1P8ZSQopJc7Of2nOEBLOQ 3 the hidden gem in summerlin this is a little restaurant separated from the gaming side hidden by the lake in summerlin we didnt expect much from this place but after reading the great reviews and it being so close to our home we had to try itit was great heres why friendly staff always smiling and its a relief to see people working in fb in las vegas that look like they are genuinely happy the food im sorry to say but i didnt expect great food i was mistaken everything we tried was pretty dang good the breakfast burrito was great the club sandwich was huge and great tasting the quesadilla was maybe my favorite ive ever had with the peppers inside the crema on top and it wasnt greasy at all corn beef hash was also good the eggs and bacon may be the downfall for them they seem like they are instant and the bacon was majorly overcooked looking forward to trying the chicken pot pie and some other things there price it is very fairthis place feels like a little local spot back home for us so for that and the other reasons i listed we will be coming back a lot 
PToUJHmAOQplcDqj5HFnFw 5 i am somewhat new to comics i read some as a kid but really just started getting into them more as an adult i have been in some comic book shops where it feels like being a newbie is a bad thing and they dont really want you there this isnt that type of placethe staff is great they answer all my questions without some weird superiority judgment they also remembered me by name after only a few visits they set up a subscription box for me to keep track of the comics i want they matched some prices i found online for some back issues i needed they call around to other stores to track down the issues you may need they have a decent rewards card that when you fill it up you get a free book the toys there are pretty fairly priced as welloverall great place
rzYTA7Wjg-ct3Xe7aI5vCw 5 i recently planned my birthday party here complete with trying the monster pizza challenge i have to say from the time i called to ask about having my party there to the time we left that night the staff there was awesome its so rare to find genuinely friendly staff in las vegas they had our reservation perfect and gave my party its own side of the restaurant there was games for the kids the pizza was very good roberto is a great manager owner and he accommodated us with every need we had which included staying open a little late do yourself a favor and go and support a las vegas business that deserves your money time and appetite ps  all you other las vegas business owners go to grazianos pizza and take note of how to treat customers right
S_9Bp4k_VhF96iHfkHmtzA 5 great food great service definitely go try this place i havent tried the eggtofu but have had everything else and its great fries are awesome
Tu8F31A68RplGzO0Dc0GEQ 5 love this placebasically this is chipotlesubway of pizza great and fair prices quality ingredients daily specials friendly staff beergreat concept this place really does things right the white pizza was great as well as the classic margherita pizzathe downside i think for this place is the name its hard to associate custom built with pizza especially if you are driving down the street and cant see the pizza part written very small to me this seems like a great name for a cabinet maker or somethingwe love this place and hope it survives the rough las vegas restaurant market but it doesnt ever seem that busy and i think the name is whats hurting it  what helps this place word of mouth and yelp reviews
7zBs0pdvjArtKjVR7RH7yQ 3 we came here on a friday around 500 i was a little nervous because of the other reviews but all in all it was a great experience its not like i was expecting much for 499 we have 3 kids and since kids under 4 eat free we fed our family for under 20 the pizza was fresh and hot and they kept different varieties coming out all the time the tables were clean as were the bathrooms the staff were friendly and helpful i would absolutely go back to this location
VAa8KY-ud6Ua_SBQmtuGEA 1 wanted to try this restaurant as we live nearby and couldnt figure out where to park finally we went around to the back and found only valet parking we went to rosie mccaffreys instead
yxdIh2zBNDpxKouVKbMtuA 5 we chose vanna to take care of our mature golden retriever cody many times over 7 years ending when cody passed in early 2016  vanna demonstrated such care and love for cody and we were comforted when we were away knowing he was in the best care  vanna has a knack for taking care of multiple dogs at a time and cody always had so much fun with her and the other dogs  she walked her guest dogs many times a day and cody got more exercise and play than he did with us  when we returned cody was always so happy and healthy and he looked like hed just had a dream dogcation  cody would always get excited when we walked towards her place it was clear he really enjoyed his time with vanna and her other guest dogs  vannas rates were the lowest in the area too  if you want your dog get the best exercise food love and attention and a chance to live and play with other dogs they are pack animals i very highly recommend vannas services  cody had a much improved quality of life because of vanna
HAGBBc0EThybIfWq2zQ4kg 5 first of all these are amazing cupcakes a little slice of heaven really the best cupcakes i have ever had and i have had a few secondly the people that work here are super friendly and responsive  we had a window for delivery time but when i called to see when they were coming within the timeframe because we had plans they changed their delivery route to come to our hotel and worked around our schedule and they were so gracious about it the delivery person wouldnt even take a tip  class act all the way around
rV6b-1ICuJ0sI4tdbmSD7g 5 excellent place with good food fast service and plenty of screens to watch the game prices are affordable and the service was prompt and courteous
-JZrDxBDTvD5Y5zf1JFI9A 5 stopped here for breakfast excellent service and the food above average  the place is very nice and comfortable the waiter kept my coffee cup filled without me having to ask the prices very reasonable we came back for a late lunch once again the food and service  were excellent food portions are generous and appealing the waiter kept my water glass filled and removed dishes as soon as we were done in both ocasiones the bill arrived promptly a very nice place
YIF_DDmOsCJgwefNaGA7Tw 1 saturday night a super busy place the atmosphere is definitely lively the food was ok i ordered the meatloaf  it came with soggy and greasy onion rings left them untouched my partner ordered the pub hamburger with a side of crunchy onion rings onion rings soggy and limp  not a place to recommend
eeMZdlmx8UYGyfzB5XzYTA 5 this was probably the best seafood meal i have ever had and in pittsburgh who knew 2 locals on the strip recommended this restaurant when i asked where we should eat atop mount washington they both stated monterey bay fish grotto the drinks were excellent as was the ambiance the view was amazing and we werent even by the window but elevated to where we could see everything incredible the appetizer was to die for and the meal itself was superb i had the parmesan crusted swordfish my husband had the crabcake with sea scallops and our daughter had the crabcakes all were cooked to perfection and plated beautifully our server knew what she was talking about and was very helpful in our selections for dessert we shared creme brulee and the angel food grilled cheese oh my word talk about delicious if you dont eat anywhere else in pittsburgh this is the place to try
HAMqF3h7h9dFtc9t8z3paw 1 first i stay at the grand every year for ces last year was really nice but this time i am very disappointed with the room and the cleaning crew when i got to my clean room i was great by the housing keeping they had just cleaned my room min before i got in i decided to use the rest room to wash up before hitting g the strip and noticed that the bathroom was clean but on spot the shower wall had black long womens hair on the wall i called the front desk to get house keep up to clean it they did cone and cleaned the rest room but fit some reason they did not clean the wall were the hair was i had to call three times before someone would c lean it not very happy with my stay and its only the first night
g8WVsxQvtJ5iP0bUarXrSg 1 my family and i travelled to montreal for a week after reading a couple reviews we decided to grab some dinner at this location we arrived around 5 pm and it was not busy we were not greeted or seated for a good 510 minutes after walking into the door the waiter did not seem to know much about the menu or he did not bother to explain any of it to us we ordered some appetizers most of the food was bland with no flavor their spring rolls are not authentic spring rolls most likely spring rolls catered for nonasian lets see it took about 10 minutes to get seated and the appetizers came out 15 minutes after we ordered but after finishing out appetizers and waiting approximately 2030 minutes after our mains had still not arrived so we asked the waiter how much longer our main courses would take he looks at us then looks down at his hand which had our orders he did not put the orders through this was horrible service and he did not even apologize he would looked annoyed anytime he looked at our table keep in mind that when we walked in there was only 2 occupied tables it was already getting late and we decided to wait for the main course the pho had the weakest broth i have ever tasted everyone else food was either cold or bland horrible food and terrible service
w-9rcSWXwzhpx2NcPjJbJA 5 great for tourists and the food is amazing they have a wide selection from sandwiches and salads the service was amazing with such a busy atmosphere although the seating is a bit crowded the food will not disappoint this is a must visit place
Cx67XHccKO1ngOkqhOaQ0g 5 if youre a tourist come here the service was nothing short than superb came to montreal to visit some friends and explore the city we had a reservation and we greeted kindly as soon as we walked in our waiter was friendly and lively more importantly patient as we had difficult time choosing what to have we ended up getting quite of bit of food to share among all of us the food was terrific the beef tartar was packed with flavor and ask for extra bruschetta because there is only 3 pieces along with the order duck poutine and shepherds pie makes my mouth water every time i think about it their wine selection was not bad and had all of the essentials we had a great time among friends and the staff and the food with wine is amazing
g4Ne97Z4zeacIffwSekL3Q 5 matt is the hardest working and most dedicated worker i have ever met every previous worker i have used to clean my dryer vent took the easy route and did a half quality job matt squeezed into areas my two year old boy would have trouble getting into just to make sure the job was done correctly and on top of this is half the price of every other company i called at the end of the job he told me that he probably saved another dryer fire from occurring and that makes it all worth it truly loves his work i will never call another company again

Rqs0bz4IbEvGHEZL4chxDw 3 my rating would be a 5 if it wasnt for the tom yum soup the soup was good but ive had better however their green curry and drunken noodles were outstanding spice level and consistency was perfect they even stayed open late to let us finish our dinner fantastic
rDsKttj1Cin1P1JpP-lEyg 3 so far so good service has been awesome beer has been great the carne asada quesadilla was yummy the margarita pizza was excellent and the buffalo chicken slider was tasty i was not impressed with the black angus and pulled pork sliders the pulled pork turned out to be carne asada and not pork at all and the angus was only a burger patty didnt come with toppings it sauces otherwise excellent
IjbYAsSU43leeZNi5UE7Sg 1 worst green curry i have ever had the chicken and vegetables in the curry were good and fresh but the actual curry asauce was awful it said it was made with coconut milk but im thinking more like coconut water or maybe just plain water it was runny and flavorless but the spring roll that came with the lunch was good
crAOVfddTrf1ThVQJoAN0g 5 great pizza friendly staff first time trying neechis pizza as a active duty military member pizza is almost part of my everyday diet i was very impressed with the taste and the amount of toppings the crust had good texture and was very tasty as well but the sause is what made me put them at the top of my list very unique  i havent come across before in other pizza shops that ive been at across the country  san diego texas north chicagomichiganohio i travel alot so i like to get a taste of everyones pizza and they offered me me a military discount which helps us military guys out thank you neechies

VUHnZ4quLUaigowEH_MKnA 1 horrible service waited for a half hour didnt get our appetizer while everyone who was seated after us was served  the server didnt even get our order until 1520 mins of being seated i get its a new restaurant but it shouldnt take that long for our appetizer to get to the table the manager had to go to the kitchen and get our food that was probably just sitting there then when we got our food the waitress came over and said she forgot our onion rings so upset with the dining experience food was alright but still didnt need to take over an hour to get everything to our table thought this was a burger place
P1ykWPA1P0Unqu4epHcqdg 3 this was an excellent restaurant with a great ambience and lovely food i was in town looking for a great place to eat which would serve fresh food with high quality in reasonable portions and i stumbled upon this place the service was great the food was excellent quality and taste and minimal disruptions i ordered the kale and arugula salad which i did not realize had bacon on it the server did not even question my concern and right away replaced the salad for my convenience and satisfaction i was so impressed at how she did not even question it and said no problem we will just change the for you to make sure you are happy with your food choice i would really recommend this place
qQtp2EtDW9iOJkz2Pa4AYw 1 food great service horribly not enough staff to handle a small amount of customer had to wait forever for each step of the process be prepared to have to shave again during the meal
kdhG9o9fJZwuSwk6qrNsWA 1 slow and understaffed  looked past me and took known guy behind
SOUnhCZVlAIkGRHAm8cu1g 5 always quick and efficient the price is right every time i go probably twice a month i do the 15 wash which includes exterior and interior and my car always comes out like new within 15min
8osa6iIynfQBHrS_cxB1iA 5 i am not usually a fan of burritos but wow i am obsessed with their breakfast burrito and all of their pastries are fantastic ive definitely found my favorite place to grab breakfast or lunch or just a sweet treat
imZ0ZKiV5AhxqIDCJzHcRA 5 one of my favorite places to get a drink and a great meal largely because you cant bet the beautiful and relaxing atmosphere you can sit right next to the golf course while watching the sun set over the mountains and service is always fast and friendly
U5_1pvL1sO27LMfEVhgsgg 5 service and atmosphere was really great and had a fun twist on decor food came out quickly and the portion size was large got the la vaca loca that had the steak flavoring was great but ordered with the green sauce and i didnt really taste or see it in the burrito so maybe it was forgotten so instead i loaded it with the side of salsa given and side of guacamole that i ordered and omg so good salsa and guac was awesome and so fresh definitely will be going back for a nice quick lunch
v2LE8OeTOS-wvhjW34Dmhw 5 this place is absolutely amazing and service outstanding the atmosphere is relaxing with stunning views which makes this place one i keep coming back to again and again prices are completely reasonable and i believe a little cheaper when compared to the other high end spas in the area the restorative organic massage is my favorite since it uses hot towels to massage your back and includes a scalp massage and foot scrub
n0qdoqUMdrOzJ5CJcJNAhQ 5 of course the food and drinks were perfect like always cocktails are a must and you cant go wrong with any one especially their mai tai we always do a full meal of appetizer entree the snapper steak salad or fish tacos are my favorites and dessert when we go because everything is just so good hands down my favorite restaurant in the scottsdale area you just cant pass up a beach paradise atmosphere in the desert
gUXVzIoXADXLCmzRCKnh9A 5 after shopping around for cushion replacement not only did i get the best price and customer service here but valerie even came to my home at no additional charge to measure everything she even offered to discard the old ones for me  if theyre in good enough condition they donate them to dog shelters to be used as beds which is such an amazing idea they had the best selection of fabrics from different manufactures including sunbrella tommy bahama outdura and pindler valerie was also really helpful to narrow down choices that helped me stay in budget but as she mentioned you can start here and the skys the limit
V63BNnG12ZwePjQG7USPoQ 3 loved the loose leaf tea meal wasnt my favorite but i got an egg dish and apparently they are more known for sweet breakfast dishes such as pancakes etc the two people i went with both got pancakes and they enjoyed them
7lAq38kMwk81v6jxTNyQng 1 i had such high high hopes for this place truly i too toured the facility and i like marc t was in awe of the facility and the cleanliness everything was so new and properly stored i felt like if i had to put my baby somewhere this is what i would want  i did in fact enroll my child for the summer program the rates are high but i figured someone has to pay for the amazing aquarium that was mentioned in the previous review and it included snacks and breakfast  lunch so i dove in with much push my husband finally agreed to let me pay the fees which included a enrollment fee of 150 plus the first week you are charged weekly on fridays i chose to put my child on an easypay system where they would pull out weekly for his tuition mistake 1 the first week they charged us our normal tuition plus enrollment fee 183 for 3 days mon wed fri  150 enrollment then no less than 3 days later they charged us again this being our first week my husband and i were a little taken aback but we figured eh maybe a fluke  after addressing the issue with  kaylee we were told no worries well note your account and we just wont charge you for next week great i thought lets move forward then 3 days later another charge now i was getting a little annoyedi dont know your financial situation but the tuition is high so these accidental charges were starting to hurt after the 3rd accidental charge again i went to the office and spoke with angela the finance director and i told her we were a little concerned we had only been attending one week and already had been charged for 3 weeks plus enrollment i kindly asked for a refund as i didnt mind waiting for the first accidental charge to catch up i was more than a little peeved about the other charges i talked to selena and she told me that i needed to bring in my credit card statement that showed the chargeslol i wasnt lying dont they keep records of what they are charging peoples cardsangela tells me suuuuure you can have a refund in 68 weeks 68 weeks because your finance department cant keep its records straight i snatched up my easy pay document so fast she had a paper cut so i let it go again really didnt have a choice we were 3 weeks in on charges i continued to bring my son when i would pick up my son the room was so hot i could smell the childrens sweat but this is az heat so i figured man the ac must be working hard to keep this place cool and i would bring him at 8 so maybe they had just turned it on one of my biggest concerns was the child to teacher ratio were talking 15 kids to every one teacher why because thats the minimum that the state will allow wouldnt you want your child to go to place that goes above a beyond the bare minimum it was a zoo when i would have to get him early there was no less than 35 kids in the class at any given time great i thought a great way for him to socialize with children his age they called me less then 1 hour into his class saying that my son had attacked a little boy when i went to get him thinking my son had mauled a little boy i was very upset he had never hit before when i walked in he was sitting alone i assume time out which i am okay with but when i asked if the little boy was okay i looked he had a scratch the size of a sewing needle not downplaying what my son did he should never hit but they are 5 they are learning they are going to get into scuffs  my son came home on the 3rd day with a large scratch on his forehead i didnt say anything because i get it they have scuffs and boys can be a little rough after the 2nd time i chose to remove him from the program just in time in my opinion i just got a letter saying they needed another 150  for supplies lolacross the hall from my sons class was the infant room my heart would break to see the infants crying with no one trying to console them as a mother i know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they arent required to have more teachers in the class it just made me so sad to see this daily   the staff is super unfriendly i actually stopped smiling to them because you know that feeling when you smile at someone and they look a you like you have gone mad smiling at themin conclusion if you feel the need to enroll you must be okay with the following1 your child must never make a mistake like get a little rough with another kid if you work plan to miss a few days because you will be asked to come and get him2 have an endless supply of money because they will need it 150 enrollment 150 for supplies  must be for the starbucks plus tuition 3 must be okay with unfriendly staff drop your kid and leave 4must be able to figure out their plans they dont tell you crap till day ofupdate the school asked that i remove this postugh i think not
tsSqmOBEarX77lsjRfm09w 1 ive been taking route 57  courtney park for the past 6 years and its been a disaster this route operates only every half an hour during rush hours and even that is with lots of problems  sometime one bus doesnt show up at all there is never any action taken to accommodate for the problems on the route or with the bus breaks down  the bus stops either in terminal or even enroute have no shelter and waiting so long in cold winters is not fun
t0OkYMxZPKFlDSx7MmN9pA 1 the water for the shower was not hot enough the rooms are pretty old and our refrigerator was faulty not the best place to stay
-MdaLtTGWryNDkKzJG6Auw 1 the service throughout the night was inconsistent  i asked how the shrimp was prepared  the server said medium we prepare all of our fish medium uncooked shrimp no thanks  we ordered two appetizers a salad steaks and a side dish  the oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces  the salad was good tomatoes were fresh  the lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl  one steak was overcooked came out medium well instead of medium rare  the server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together  we felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this  however the steak never came out  i asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready  she came back from the kitchen frazzled and said it will be out but i dont have a time to give you  then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat set it down did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left it was very fatty and appeared to be not the cut of meat filet that i had ordered  it was over cooked again  the server happened to walk over and said yes i thought that it didnt look right  i left without eating dinner  she brought the check over and said im sure you guys dont want dessert so i brought the check  the manager never followed up to see if i had received the new steak  the issues couldve easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through  they did credit the check for two steaks but really that was not the issue  unfortunately this restaurant was a big let down
xczaWzd3tMgL7btH3H5gow 5 had the giglio pasta tonight it was amazing i usually dont write reviews but i felt this dish exceeded expectations service was excellent appreciate the attentiveness to our two children present as well thanks for making it a nice night out
uHiUFtpz80uMWxu8bGWZNg 5 learned about the establishment by chance  i went to the craig location and was blown away by the quality of the poke  i was so stoked when i learned that they have a south location the customer service is superb and you can sample all the different poke personally i like the spicy ahi poke salmon with special sauce this is definite must try
97c672k4eUCN3qGMw7TXpA 5 recently i have been searching for a window cleaning service for my new business  out of all the companies i called this was the only one who answered their phone  as scheduled he came on time got the job done very quickly  i was suprised at the difference in appearance after getting our windows cleaned  to top it all off he was very affordable  highly recommended
rtUz24fd7RimXLFqwBcgqg 5 great service the food is phenomenal they have a restaurant connected to it so you get restaurant quality food only caveat is to make sure you make reservation early since the place can be packed
0h4pYbFtZSLTJ511afiNtQ 5 great service reasonable prices could not be happier with robert and his services
5rkG-PQvv67POYHytJ_3Lg 5 we are extremely happy with the timeliness and the quality of the service chris provided
o2n1fpH2MJizCqYP9bWTxA 5 needed a schedule b service on my 2014 e350knew the dealer would be expensive but would probably get the job done with minimal hassle  more than pleasantly surprised with the quality and timeliness of the work  but what compelled me to give a five star rating was the final bill  when i picked up the car i was told i needed a new pollen filter and a new air filter  i was hoping it would be just an oil and oil filter change but carlos told me they needed to be changed  i was shocked when he handed me the bill and it was at the estimated price i asked about the filters and he told me they were able to change them and honor the original estimated price  this has never happened to me at a car service place ever  never ever  i am a very satisfied customer  they did the work at a fair price and well under the dealer price  could not have asked for more
f0GLg18mQ5Q3tR70A7CBhg 5 second trip to franks and it is always a very good experience  frank is beyond fair the work is topnotch and both times the car was delivered ontime as promised  they get my highest recommendation as getting your car repaired is not the most pleasant task in the world but frank makes it as painless as possible  everybody in the shop has a great attitude
alrXi5Zmsc1W2lq0OHWMLw 5 i love the lemon pepper chicken with fried okra and feta spinach yum yum yum i wish it were open more hours
GOznKkym_lN65np3nmDofw 1 not delicious i wanted it to be but it wasnt firecracker shrimp didnt have good flavor looked like some college guys sad first attempt at stir fry ill never eat here again
IIQkjUqghEgJ0mnBymtEOA 5 this place is beyond amazing my boyfriend took me here for the first time a month ago by far the best tacos ever
FO2tw_h8Bw2o0uppTsUnhw 3 great place right on the capitol square very good food and good beer selection pretty good prices as well expect to pay anywhere from 810 for a sandwichburger with side didnt end up having the fried cheese curds like other people recommend but they did look deliciousonly gripes for this place are that you can expect to wait a while for a table and they do not take reservations second when it gets busy the service can be slightly spotty and it seemed to take a while to get our foodits such a great place though thats probably why its so busy
D3RS7nKmU_TveOArTyNBmQ 3 another great staple of madison that is a must try food is very good and beer is of course good you can get free popcorn for the table order food and drinks at the bar and they bring it out to youthe outside seating area is awesome too in both summer and fall a must try if you are going through madison
A2K9InLMRkhNnzWI6pjdVg 3 came here in the winter january and still had a lovely time walked around the outside areas where we were told the things to see included grasses and barkwho doesnt love a conservatory in winter nice steamy walk through an area teeming with life great variety of plants and trees to see along with some birds mostly quail for some reason im a sucker for pitcher plants for which there were a number for me to see around the conservatory would definitely like to come back in springsummer
SJ_FkWA9GZEn1YvmJOO2NQ 3 this is a fun place in madison to come hang out especially on fridays or weekends was pretty packed this past friday when i went and at first was kind of too much craziness luckily we had reserved seats and people seemed to settle down after the first couple innings as lines for beer and food shortened considerablylove the beer that they have here lots of great dane brews and more common craft brews food is pretty good with burgers brats pulled pork chicken fries slaw potato salad all availablewould recommend paying the 5 for the reserved seating in advance though the only drawback is that this is not like a picnic table so it is a bit hard to have a group there in reserved seats and all be comingling unless you are getting up a lot regardless this is still a fun time and it shows by how packed it gets
GCgUJTpbrcaPeGC76wZJpw 3 it is pricey for the average golfer but if you are an avid one who appreciates good golf courses and experiences this is a great choice played the desert and canyon courses which were both in very good shape cool layouts with some challenges including some tight holes overall though this is a very beautiful course on se side of camelback mountain only criticism is that we got out early on the desert course and played pretty quickly only to get stuck behind a whole bunch of groups at the turn going to the canyon course the rangertime starter guys couldnt exactly explain why that happenedoverall though this is a great course with nice amenities grass tees gps in cart would definitely come play again
PflxNu9c5UL8WLddFgIYdg 3 course was in great shape and is reasonably priced for a tpc course this is a fun course to play but is very tight great location right at the marriott in scottsdale and is convenient to get to from most placesthe people were friendly except for one guy in the pro shop interestingly the 18th hole is the only one where there were some quality issues as the fairway and green were not in as good of shape as the rest of the courseall in all though i would definitely return
zomIGnSmCDWM6Ud9lLaX4g 5 the only knock i have on this course is that it is a bit pricey which is a common complain of mine but overall this was a great course and a great experiencewe played in late december so there was a frost delay but once we got off it was sunny and not very cold the group in front of us was playing a bit slow from the outset and by the third hole the ranger was on them to speed up which they didcourse is playable for many skill levels my group played the tips and are above average golfers and we enjoyed our experience a lot it was not an overly challenging course but still required skill very professionally run course with 3 separate nines we played ironhead and acacia course was in good shape and greens rolled true only additional complaint would be that the restaurant was under construction and not open for another month or so and when we went to the only other shop which had food they were out of some different beers and other items which they had on display and made it seem like they did have them availablei would return
WDHVhfsADJNdu-5Wd9zTNA 3 not much to complain about here good food on the east side of madison with a good beer and drinks menu i had the bison burger which was fantastic and got the side of cucumber cilantro quinoa people i was with had skirt steak again delicious with garlic mashed potatoes you guessed itdelicious very nice wait staff and good homey kind of place if i lived in madison i would definitely come back to this place as a staple
C8TbA1WEfXWjHKzifQ4Yjw 3 this course is on the less expensive end of the scale for scottsdale which still means fairly pricey i believe it was around 8090 per person in prime season in end of march there is no driving range but we went to one of the courses nearby beforehand which wasnt very far awayoverall though thought the course was pretty solid with a nice layout greens in good shape course had some challenges but also had an overall layout that seemed to keep the ball findable because everything sloped inward got out at 845 or so and played pretty quickly would definitely come back for more
TbfeWsbxIRVBAyT8Nk3gAA 5 found this place on yelp while i was on vacation in scottsdale so figured we would try it out and it was wonderfulthe service was great and there wasnt really anyone else there when we went so arturo stopped by and offered us some of the habanero tequila apparently he makes it wow it was hot not really for me but very interesting and awfully cool of him to come out and offer us somefood was great i had three different tacos calimarii blackened fish and carnitas and all were awesome other people in my party got blackened fish entree the carnitas entree the carne asada entree everyone was happyfriendly people and great food pricing was very reasonable too my tacos were 250299 each and most entrees were in the 6950 rangewould definitely return
zyCkXpwh92wS70wID4Fslg 3 cool distillerybar east of madison didnt really see a lot of the distillery but mainly there is a drinking room they have a menu of different cocktails was there on a saturday around 6 and it was fairly busypricing is pretty good  generally 6 per mixed drink try the honeycap
Dt-A-Pm1wHviLPI_-nPm6A 3 always hard to judge how strenuous a hike is from reading reviews cause you dont know peoples fitness levels this will definitely present a challenge for people that dont exercise much as the first part is fairly steep and continues for probably about 3045 minutes we took the trail up to toms thumb and back which took at least 2 hours round trip we started early like some recommended to take advantage of shade on the first part of the trail at that time of day and it was a great idea the trail itself though is very nice aesthetically with great views and an interesting path the trail to toms thumb is pretty well marked the view from toms thumb is great and you marvel at seeing the trailhead parking lot off in the distance seeing where you started from
8aseofzW4xTEwWDDHbrUkA 5 great mexican place in downtown madison just off state street this place strikes you as very authentic perhaps it was something about the luchador fights on tv in the restaurant with the spanish commentaryfood was awesome had tostadas and gorditas which were both fantastic chorizo steak pastor pork  cant go wrong you can buy individual tostadas or gorditas for 3503 each though there are lots more options also had this amazing drink that was like milk with cinnamon toast crunch flavoring definitely check that out
slyLW324PBZb8DRoCGBaMg 5 been to the dane county farmers market more times than i can count over the years what an awesome event every saturday atmosphere is wonderful the market extends around all 4 sides of the capitol highlights of the market are the wonderful fresh food trying all the awesome cheese samples curds fried cheese aged cheese etc doesnt get much better than the fried cheese great pastriesbakery items too  hot and spicy cheese break donuts muffins scones etc ive also bought vegetable plants from the market and theyve seemed to turn out better than ones you buy from home depot or somewhere like thattruly an awesome place lots of people though and if you get there after 10 it is pretty crazy busy more like a crawl around the capitol
PaAhCPNps4JWpMZwcqHLAw 3 im always surprised at how hard it is to find good pad thai but this was always good service was usually good i would do both sit down and carry out and had good experiences with bothmainly remember this place for the solid pad thai nice people cash only
U0X075Kt8oxWPxo4-b3dIw 3 saw this place on diners driveins and dives and had to come try the brioche french toast we went on a week day and it wasnt very crowded everyone seemed to enjoy their food that i was with people got omelet the wolfpack hash browns with eggs and bacon in between more hash browns though noone thought it was outstandingthe brioche french toast i had came with caramelized bananas and pecans and i had to ask for more bananas because i literally was brought 34 small slices of banana on top of my french toast and the pecans were all bits and pieces to their credit they brought me out a lot more bananas and they were caramelized and in the caramel saucei would definitely return
WdyMjsAyvmRwBOJvNwvZxw 3 this place is nice but nothing outstanding if you are looking for a place to go and get pampered this is not the place for you the pool is nice and the hot tub is pretty large and awesome  the only restaurant on the premises is a small snack shop by the pool which has sandwiches and such the rooms have kitchens which provide what you need if you want to make your own food while you are there there is a breakfast provided from 8845 two days a week which is nice but isnt out for long after the 845 end time during that time you are presented different activities and excursion type stuff you can do in the areathe concierge is definitely helpful as they recommended a good breakfast place though there are others and helped us get a tee time at a discounted rate at a nice course nearbyassuming you have a car going to sedona is a must and is a pretty drive up there also interesting if you are adventurous and are comfortable driving on unpaved roads in the mountains is driving the apache trail which goes out to tonto national forest and roosevelt lakei would likely go somewhere else if i went back to scottsdale as i wasnt blown away by the place but it depends what type of vacation you are looking for the place was clean but the maid service didnt really do much
Bp7fEbRXhjYQpGvHCTlRaQ 5 oh this place is soooooo gooooooooood brunch buffet is absolutely ridiculous  prime rib on sunday every kind of breakfast food you can imagine for a little extra you get all you can drink mimosas cinnamon rolls are awesomefor dinner i was a huge fan of the cheddar burger you get a ton of shredded cheddar on top and the prosciutto pizza beer was great tooservice is typical decent prices food is fricking awesome
izoGsnF1RIfouhBroVksxw 5 this place rocks would come here very often if i still lived in madison everything from the food to the setup to the dcor is awesome not been to many places where you go to find more seating upstairs and it basically feels like you just got home there are tables and then a whole loftstyle area with couches and comfy chairs where people can hang out but in an authentic way not the forced starbucks kind of waythe food is stellar got the chorizo skillet which was amazing my part also indulged in blueberry and raspberry scones which were awesome taking cues from the other recommendations i enjoyed a nice hazelnut coffee and then got the free refill also loved how you can take jars of preservativesjam to your table to which were also delicious
JGO8m4vQqXoHzQdKKiswhQ 3 went for the tour and drinking on a summer saturday pretty nice little saturday tour is 5 and they just take you through the warehouse and some of the brewing area it isnt anything overly special if youve been on other brewery tours before it is a pretty standard onebeer i great though with the 5 tour you get a small tasting glass and three different tastings they have the staples along with more seasonal and experimental type brews pretty reasonable prices too if you want beerspitchers also which you will pitchers are generally around 11
I_GE8a4C5FTS6XEulq6lLg 1 worst cup cakes ever  my husband and i tried the salted caramel and the peanut butter and chocolate and they were both very dry and heavy there was no hint of salt with the salted caramel cupcake
lIE9-jRlix5ac5RrHdkwFQ 5 excellent service and results always prompt and we receive a call from our regular provider dean the day before he comes to ensure the time is convenient
y__v7cc2SEfEn1Z9NWxF_A 5 so after my walk from whalburger which is in an earlier review also amazing we headed to the fuel bar  professional flaretenders  sooshey and the guys throw up a mean cocktail with some sick tricks to go with it  i have been to places where flare was the theme but the drinks tasted like sweaty nut water but here the drinks were amaze balls i suggest getting the moscow mule and try to find the bogo coupons they have floating around
gKmkOVwpnxU4A8Mp6oggTQ 5 wow best dang burger get the beast omergerd this is the pot of gold at the end of a dark and contaminated rainbow  after a long night of being humped and grinded on by degenerate girls full of plastic and daddy issues this was my nirvana  it tasted better than the silicon titty that was in my mouth the night before i only wish it were in dallas
FeYCURv6pO0IPfbOgejgNw 5 hands down the best sushi i have ever had with a lot of great options to choose from and the customer service to match it but you will pay for it
5Q7w_ksDJWE-dbP3d5kIqg 1 got 1000 worth of tires today they told me it would be a long wait  theyd call me when done i waited from noon till 3pm the tires were done  145 pm they said they were too busy to call 3hrs for the guy in front of me for a flat tire fix when he complained erick his service guy said thank you with a smirk and walk away dont recommend them the change in staff since the last few tire sets i purchased is quite noticeable they need customer service training
yjgm1_GMxV0ioIXfqISIkQ 3 i was kind of hesitant when i seen that a thrift boutique was coming to the neighborhood but when i chose to stop in it was a pleasurable experience very upper class they have clothing men woman children some sporting kitchen baby items great condition some prices could be lower but over all not too badive been in twice looking forward to going back to see what is new
pKM06pwDNSWBxoITUkTT0g 5 i recently moved to the area and was looking to get my oil changed on my vehicles walked in and spoke to carloshe was very helpful and polite made an appointment for both my vehicles got everything i needed and was updated on when and how often i needed to do further maintenance carlos shared with me what type of oil to use spark plugs ectno one had ever done that before i was actually treated like a person and not a female who didnt know anything this was a great experience will highly recommend oh and something else i didnt expecti now have an online garage where i can keep track of my maintenance and they offer coupons too wow
33hP4MrYb0xDykxPNERcJQ 3 nice atmosphere good service and quality food at a great price i know this sounds really gimmicky but im a real customer im just getting straight to the point
YZ-18xeXPACWT8XSpC5vpw 1 i thought maybe this was a hidden gem not at all food was okay space is very dank service was horrible my dinner counterpart did not like her meal the waitress response sorry after asking the item to be removed from the bill the waitress and owner literally argued with us since she had taken a few bites how else can you tell you dodont like something a few days later im noticing they ran my debit card twice never again
e0NxyPeWMhnxu_LKIDUgpA 5 this place is true to its name i agree with some of the other ratings ive read about the friendly staff good machines and comfortable environment only downfalls are that the wifi doesnt always connect to my pc and that they dont do alterations w dry cleaning i can def overlook those things however oh and i love that the machines accept debitcredit cards note that itll automatically take about 15 dollars out though then comp the difference afterwards
Mw-jId89JYkQJK27kyE84Q 3 tr lawing handled my business very professionally the only recommendation would be to improve contact accessibility thank you
PK9p3TI4FlGJP3bGnRpbkQ 5 i went here with my wife for a spur of the moment date night the club itself is very nice and the staff was great we shared the pickle fries and spinach artichoke dip which were both very good we even got to witness someone literally spit their entire drink up from laughing so hard overall a great place to hang out and laugh your ass off
t_THKBXiQAwlD413e5YyaA 1 cheap prices but id rather pay full price for decent foodcalamari was greas instead of crispy served on a bed of tomato sauce rather than dipping sauce prime rib sliders tasted like the meat had spent the last week in the refrigerator before being served last was the tenderloin skewers  my wife ate them as i had lost my appetiteshe said the best part was the sauteed spinach they were served on ya they shoved a wooden skewer into 3 chunks of random shaped  over cooked salty meatwaitress was very nice and was sure to remind me how cheap the bill was i guess so i wouldt stiff on the tipmy beer was nice  cold i should have stopped there
rWCnSQs1Rho9wIuFM1ISWA 5 excellent food a wide variety of different pasta seafood steaks  the etouffee was delicious with plenty of sauce to rice ratio  the chicken alfredo was more than enough for a hungry 7 year old the finale was the chocolate mouse cake  the service was excellent thanks to the waitress melissa  great date place with table cloths and cloth napkins and a chilled fork for your salad
DSBfDSF8gRoC2gqaf99rGg 5 was very helpful  we had a session on finaces and preparing for future retirement  the consultentcoach encouraged me where needed and gave good advice  please try out the services
Dm5tU_e86c6K0hbBrw_Ldw 1 i should have checked the box before i got home i ordered for pickup i understand this is a pizza place but i paid over 10 for 5 burnt chicken fingers and 10 burnt fries i literally counted 10 fries how was that acceptable to serve on a plate as a cook and then as a cashier how could you let someone walk out with that i was so hungry and too pissed to go back when i got home extremely disappointed with the sky pointe location
PyTApFwPL9yjep29MhTa5w 5 keith was my sales rep he was awesome i had to take care of a busted iphone 6plus screen and decided to just ditch the iphone all together i was totally prepared to turn the iphone in and get the 80 credit so i wouldnt have to deal with fixing it keith explained all of my options and i had a clear understanding of what i was getting i switched from verizon was very important i keep my number he transferred my  contactsoffered to transfer photos if needed had the screen protector put on my phone the best part is he did all of this in 20 minutes everyone at this store was extremely professional and friendly keith understood what i needed and i felt comfortable about making the switch from verizon after 14 years nicholas and robbi sp were knowledgeable and professional as wellthanks again i left the store feeling like i got exactly what i needed and was looking for if youre looking for an efficient fast professional you can trust i would go to this location
5C6fAk8p27ouZuByPPi0CQ 5 this was honestly the best time ive ever had getting my photo takenmy last passport photo was taken at a blacks and was so bad that customs agents actually laughed every time they saw itin comparison i actually look so much better in this photo than i do in real life john the owner absolutely adores what he does from the second i walked in he had nothing but compliments for me he gives you the option to choose from multiple poses and then takes the best one and does some slight photoshop magic to make it even better he then prints it while you waitcash only  all in it cost 790 for 2 passport photos with the official stamp and he threw in an additional one for my mom overall it took 10 minutes for the whole experience but it also never felt rushed im tempted to go back to get other random photos taken just because he made me feel so good about myself be sure to ask him about the time he was in a movie with mark wahlberg  he has the photos to prove it
PDU0uu6XG5S7H1XgJSUPyg 5 the food was good and our bartender rob made excellent drinks everything was made well and the prices were even better rob was also very friendly great bartender
BjpVFGMPlubN07Ob0Ekw1w 5 i made my husband try some jello shots and he was buzzed off of just a few of them great little place for booze
MConJEiPRN81X5duunLCnA 5 we have been coming here for years for sushi andy is a sushi master and we love him sit at the sushi bar and he will make you something custom based on what you like or dislike he is incredible
L-lV_kfVkupUom8k6DbqCw 5 their black beans are to die for i could live off of them i recommend just getting take out because the seating area isnt the greatest it is cafeteria style
sArWqzoR03SBz1OGfa6RaA 5 love the atmosphere here shattered chips are delicious we took our leftovers of them home and added buffalo sauce and they were even better the chef came outside and asked how our meal was and the manager also stopped by you never see this at smaller restaurants so that was a great perk we had the paris texas burger and the chicken sandwich both amazing would recommend to everyone
PghtfKDZVlhFlQvnjmBWzQ 5 cant say enough good things about this placefood is fabulous staff is fabulous i cant get enough of their peanut butter cookies and thai chicken saladyum
gplIFzWFOh1SZQiDDXectQ 5 had dinner there last night and everything was spectacular the ambiance and architecture of the restaurant is super hip looking forward to sitting on the patio too our server joy was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and helped us pair our drinks with the food we ordered we had some oysters the avocado salad salmon and the radio milano pasta dish and it all tasted delicious their cocktail list is really inventive and yummy this is definitely going to be the new hot spot in arcadia cant wait to go back and try more of the food and drinks
cFh79ovm4gnQ7ulWMKRMYg 1 we have visited this place multiple times over the past few years and when i found out they had a private room for me and my guests i was so excited at first they were very accommodating they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menus with us it came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out everything just went downhill from there we complained to our server multiple times we had 1 server for a party of 40 that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it i had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner then when half of our guests left i realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it i was then told we should have requested dessert to come out what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finishedmy biggest disappointment was how the catering manager michelle handled everything after i sent her an email i understand that she is the owners wife but ive had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did she was brash and offensive not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues you can count on the fact that i will never recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked which is unfortunate because i work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations i sure hope the lack of customer service turns people off from dining here you are better off going to cheesecake factory
CNpQ9A9peEdVkhwzEghdjw 5 we tried the coronado cafe last night and it exceeded our expectations  the ambience was lovely service excellent and the food was fabulous  their meatloaf this is not your mothers meatloaf has to be the best on the planet  we will definitely return
41T5LjDnNe_M6ANOgmD_Xg 5 they responded to my inquiry promptly and were friendly and accommodating excellent service brittany was great and did her utmost to find a time for my wife to be tattooed by sausage while that sentence out of context sounds odd we are looking forward to it in the future but maybe in 2018
AN7nMubhX-Zv0CeUb5Qm-A 5 while its been nearly a year since i had a fabulous dinner at michael mina i still think about the amazing meal i hadit was my first trip to las vegas and my boyfriend wanted to impress by taking me here he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himselfwe were recommended to try the chefs menu and also followed it with the wine pairings we both enjoyed the ahi tuna tartar loved the lobster pot pie which got the pie to innards content right i like a little breadness with each bite and both of us were in awe of the kobe with sear foie on top i dont know if they still do that but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit its in our top 2 of steaksand trust me we eat a lot of steak i dont even remember the dessert thats how mind blowing the steak was im sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at michael mina was nothing but excellentservice was impeccable and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread the wine pairings were done well but i was happy i was staying in the bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting the atmosphere was elegant without pretension or overstyling probably the most comfortable restaurant i went to in vegas most people were well dressed ie slacks and dresses but no need for anything over the top i wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks while we were probably the youngest ones there the servers didnt treat us like we didnt belong there which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants big plus for thatid love to go back but this time id probably order something different just so i could try other thingsbut id get the kobe again for sureits worth the pennies to go and try the chefs menu
0T4wp2BcFUJXPtMPhXLBOQ 3 carnevino is definitely a meatlovers joy  but maybe a little overpriced for what you getmy boyfriend is a carnivore and steakaddict to the point where his friends recommended he come herewe started with the beef tasting menu and while the crudo was well done my issue was so many places seem to do a raw kobe appetizer something a little more creative with same meat would have been lovely i will say i really loved the beefcheek ravioli  i stole my boyfriends because i felt my portion needed to have more in it personally the wet and dry aged beef were good and beefy and meaty but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak i preferred the dry aged to the wetthe wet aged just seemed a little bland in comparison we veered off course a bit  my boyfriend wanted more meat and we ordered the dryaged bone in ribeye for 2 i didnt eat much as my boyfriend devoured it but the meat was flavorful for surejust not my style ending with the tasting menu desert which i cant remember because it was so generic i think creativity could have been a lot betterservice was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well our server was so excited we wanted more steak  but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill the worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casinohotel walkway i prefer people not staring at me or my meals when i eat lastly the price while the cuts of meat were good i just dont feel the costs justified what was done in the meal the creativity was lacking and maybe its because its such a meatbased restaurantbut i feel like it could have been more creative if you liked dryaged steak and big bold italian reds this is the place for your but i prefer my steak to melt like butter in my mouth and this isnt the place for it i will tell you my boyfriend enjoyed it far more than i did otherwise maybe try another more diverse restaurant in the palazzovenetian restaurant row
VWL34PtdPAIeB8LmwJ3r9w 3 amazing steak and other food but be prepared for a slight bit of wallet shocki made reservations at cut back in may while visiting lv but due to an unfortunate bout of illness do not eat duck fried rice from the bellagio poker room  that required hospitalization i was forced to give my reservations to my friends the next day visiting me in the hospital they raved about the quality of the steaks being from overseas i knew that next time i was in las vegas i would need to gowhat luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a wsop event and we returned to las vegas and made another reservation at cut for mid junewe were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt we knew we wanted steak but my boyfriend and i have very different tastes in wine so the sommelier came over to help us with the very awkward ipad wine list she helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires after ordering our wine we got down to business for appetizers we had the kobe sashimi and the roasted beets with goat cheese they actually balanced quite nicely as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us for our main courses i chose the american wagyu filet normally 6 oz and added an extra 2 oz for extra i love kobe filet for its melting butter like quality and this cut was no exception it was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was the quality and taste i would expect for a 130 steak my boyfriend chose the new york sirloin tasting that consisted of the dry aged american sirloin american wagyu and nz wagyu he ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare which is acceptable because these cuts were thick and they were epic just meaty and buttery at the same time my steakloving boyfriend was in heaven for sides we had the mac  cheese and spring peas with bacon to be honest we didnt eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak but both were good  also rich and bacony after some excessive meat consumption i saw a souffle float by to another table i had to dig deep down but i never regretted the chocolate souffle it was rich but airy at the same time i didnt even look at the other desserts but it was one of the best ive had the small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up togo that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morningthe service was extremely attentive and water refillsbread requests came quickly and discretely yes the bread was that good too my one disappointment is the overall atmosphere the overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like i was in an hgtv show instead of a restaurant  when i think steakhouse i think a little more comfortable and a little less sleek that said i also deplored the amount of  people taking picturesman people dont use flash in a restaurant i like to eat my food without blinding if youre so consumed by where you are please avoid me at all costsoverall i recommend cut if you have money to splurge but youll be sure to enjoy your meal
g657l_BmTVOwkE2QXFs66A 3 great hotel with fabulous services and restaurant  just what phoenix needswe stayed here for a few days after trying to find a place to stay in phoenix that wasnt a chain or a massive resort for a decent price and were very pleased to find the clarendon hotelthe room we stayed in was clean large and comfortable and the bed was fantastic the keurig in the room was a great plus along with the provided robes my only complaint about the room was the tiiiiiiny bathroom however the great pool and hottub in the main courtyard really made the stay even better and we enjoyed chatting with other guests while enjoying a cocktail or beer from gallo blanco which incidentally is also fantasticmy biggest issue was the resort fee i really deplore the addition of the resort fee tacked on after you check in  please just include this in the regular price of a room when you check inbut also this isnt reaaaaaaally a resort so why such an outrageous resort fee still fee and all the clarendon hotel is worth it and provided us with a great place to stay in phoenix
Q6RiVtAINLhMIE-7wRST4w 3 this was the place i was most looking forward to eating at in vegas im sad to say i was disappointed the food was amazing but the atomosphere and service were way below the the prices they charge it felt like a cheap club with fantastic food very disconnected our server was condecending she seemed annoyed we didnt order enough shed recommended 23 cold dishes 23 hot dishes and 2 sushi rolls but that was our choice wed had a late lunch if you just want good food id recommend saving your money and going elsewhere if youre a 20 or 30something and want a party atmosphere and dont care about the bill this could be fun for you
KYZjc6reW1sHm38753ZpQA 5 i had high hopes for craftsteak and it definitely delivered fantastic food in a classy yet unpretentious environment and amazing service some notes we ordered the cheaper steaks on the menu and they were amazing melt in your mouth hard to imagine how good the waygu and other pricey ones would be but dont feel like youll be shortchanged by ordering the cheaper ones dont skip salads the fava bean salad was the best thing i ate who knew a salad could be so good sit at the bar before dinner if you have time our reservation was running a bit late so we had a drink the bartenders make the most delicious strong drinks if you love steak and want a classy dinner in vegas go here you wont be disappointed
h9y-jgYduS-bffPLxZdLnA 5 ate at china poblano when i was in vegas last week and hadnt looked at any yelp reviews prior im surprised to find it only has 3 stars on here i thought it was amazing most importanly it was priced appropriately unlike so many places in vegassome notesthe atmosphere was fun decor is amazingservice was greatfood was creative and deliciousa few dishes were a miss a noodle soup with the word ugly in the name but most were spot on mexican food was slightly better than the chinese but that makes sense given joses backgound the saltair margaritas are genius

a5ol67pRj7r0ChwImRtmhA 1 my boyfriend  i went to jozo yesterday after the gym and thought to check this place out since weve been seeing a lot of hype the place is nice and quiet menu has a good variety of options from boba to coffee to smoothies we ordered two drinks which was the classic taiwanese milk tea and the signature thai tea milk tea was alright it wasnt as sweet nor milky as most boba places thai tea was just like your regular thai tea that you get at restaurants and the boba was unusually smaller than your regular boba which was surprising coming from a boba placewhat was really disappointing was the amount of ice that was in the drink my boyfriend and i took two sips of the milk tea to try the flavor and noticed that the cup was pretty much ice the 12oz cup not even the bottle was filled with 23 ice  13 tea i know its being nit picky but i feel like i got gypped paying 450 mind you they were out of their cool bottles which comes standard with their drinks and still payed for the same price for a plain regular plastic cup  no name or anything overall i think jozo is jumping in with the trend of hipster branding but is lacking quality on the flavor wish i had a better experience

3ElX230d6vyueqgvOIP47Q 1 although the staff are very nice and the facility can accomodate a lot of people at once ease of appointment times i must say i was not thrilled by this place the physical therapists are helpful but compared to other places are not attentive enough because they are often seeing many patients at once i thought the service was very good until i visited other physical therapists that give much more oneonone time and assess your progress much more closelyexample i was often left to do my stretches with the therapists mostly coming back to give me something else to do besides asking how i felt from time to time they did not reassess my abilities to walk or stretch as other therapists have how do they know what is working if they dont assess your progress
Oe1DjRsXAU-y67ZdWTU9Mg 3 i have both eaten in and taken out with a positive experience from walking by it doesnt look like the greatest place but they have an interesting menu with different asianasian fusion dishes so theres a little bit for everyone from the exotic to the simplethe malaysian sate which i had with beef was delicious and came in a more than adequately sized portion the pad thai is also a delicious meal all of the appetizers and other dishes i tried were more than satisfactory for a student on a budget this place is both delicious and relatively inexpensive i would recommend it to anyone who likes interesting tastes of asia
Efe9J8kafodBKQGN_KexMw 1 i was excited to visit the pbc solely to experience their exotic types of burger meat i chose the salad bar option which was poorly stocked the selection did not look all that appetizingwhen ordering burgers the first selections that we made were not available so i settled on a bison burger it was not much to speak of from the bun to the toppings or even the meat itself it wasnt memorable or particularly tasty the french fries i tried seemed overdone and like they had been sitting outfrankly i would not recommend this place my meal left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied the food was not that good and the service also left something to be desired the restaurant was a little dark uncomfortable booths and didnt have a nice atmosphere if youre in the area youd be better off at red robin
8zM_xAspL-_fMXfUBDc1tg 3 seviche has a lively colorful atmosphere that added to the dining experience our server was very attentive and knew the menu very well she was able to offer many suggestions the rest of the wait staff was also helpful when it came to seating us turning the air down everythingserved tapas style the food is conducive to sharing and ordering lots of little things we tried for all ranges of the menu and thought the dishes had interesting flavor profiles were prepared well and tasted greatthe seviche section allows you to choose a fish and a style of preparation  they are delicious the filet mignon was also a wonderful cut of meatmojitos are a bit pricey at 9 a drink for the small glasses they are in but are delicious all the same
K5MSSQTowhkmh_BwEMMTtg 3 fun atmosphere good food big beersi would suggest the appetizer sampler the works as many below me will agree the sauerkraut balls are delicious the bier cheese  pretzels were good tooi had the bayerischer schweinsbraten pork with sauerkraut and a potato dumpling it was different than i expected as im not too familiar with german food but still pretty good the pork was cooked well and had a good sauce i wish i had substituted mashed potatoes instead of the dumpling
8ICcQMET5lYfYFRWskoR5Q 3 a big menu selection with even bigger size portions so big i took half of my sandwich home i thought my meal was delicious and was impressed with the amount of sandwichburger options on the menu that i was torn betweendefinitely a place to check out in southside
vedUdLAR02qnLcZmClfCqw 3 the times i have been here i was impressed at the food and service in comparison to a red robin i had visited several years ago we were seated quickly and taken care of by the wait staffi had the prime chophouse burger and the burnin love burger on two separate occasions my food came out hot fresh and cooked to my liking the fries were all newly made because it is a chain you know going in that you wont be gettin extravagant food but for a burger  fries kind of meal there are a lot of choices many of which are good
GUY9fYucroJvbpChuZnqWw 3 selfservice frozen yogurt with tons of toppings to choose from you pay by weight although there are no prices listedthey change out the flavors and have some seasonal type ones too the frozen yogurt is really delicious and i would highly recommend coming here their toppings include fruit gummy wormsbears sprinkles chocolate sauces cereal etc
nPatOrbMTZoe59hYgRHyww 3 on the multiple occasions that i have gone to this restaurant i have always had a positive and veryfilling experience their bread is delicious and hot the server always brings out tons for us i would say most of the dishes are standard italian fare i have not been disappointed by the pasta bravo eggplant parm or the side saladsthe best thing i have tried here was the chicken scaloppini the chicken is covered in melted cheese and has a great lemon sauce i would highly highly recommend this dishfor dessert try the apple turnover thing with ice cream you wont be disappointed
aLK9Zsevo1ddSvULAUjB-Q 3 i had a banquet event here and i was quite impressed with the service as well as the atmosphere the wait staff was very friendly and was able to keep everyones order straight despite the large groupi ordered a chicken dish that had a creamy sauce some potatoes and asparagus it was a great dish served hot it had way more complex flavors than i was expecting i also tried a bite of the pasta with vegetablesin a catered sit down dinner service i usually dont expect the food to be great or hot but the grand concourse is a nice exception
Vgcxw3ftUA7ZIGmacbqO2w 3 ice cream is made on the premises with a variety of traditional and very unique flavors walking past these place you can smell the waffle cones and sweet treats that are made behind their doors definitely a place to check outnegatives cash only i think they have a machine where you can take out money through an atmlike transaction but it does chargealthough delicious and i swear by it i think their ice cream is a little overpriced
kNzmm_kUbs5--7MKfVpv3w 3 pita pit is a more interesting version of subway to me you can pick from a variety of meats cheeses veggies and sauces its inexpensive and tastythe staff was friendly and made the experience even better
FfYXPbiBNqFBAEJiTVhHBw 3 i ordered take out from here and was happy with my order i had a white pizza with spinach and it was really delicious and filling the man who made the pizza was italian which adds an element of authenticity the pizza was a far size for a far price its a nice change from the other pizza options in oakland
CyizK6HHBNIe6vGXS2dN-Q 3 having eaten here several times i was unsure between 3 and 4 stars as some visitsmeals were better than others pretty solid fare bar food type not the best atmosphere inside  kind of dark gets a bit loud still enjoyable thoughhighly recommendedbuffalo chicken mac  cheese skinny dip buffalo chicken dip with chipshog heaven especially because of the side horseradish saucerussetsweet potato fry mixaveragerosemarys breastburgersalads in generalthey are known for having great pizzas but ive only ever had a bite here and therehalf price after 11 is always super crowdedgood happy hour beer priceswhen getting takeout i do feel the portions are smaller
O93ruTPKds3NMvXdtuXNxA 3 i had the bistro burger with a side order of french fries the burger was brought out to my table and i found it be simple but delicious the fries were hot and had a nice salt  pepper seasoningalthough i did not try the salad it looked great  a ton of options friendly staff to help you with your selections once you pick everything they chop it and give you dressing the salad was what i thought to be a big portion much bigger than panera and customized to what you wantthis is a great concept im sure the place will do well im told at lunch the line is already out the door and its not even the school year yetits also nice how they have garage style doors at the front to keep a nice breeze coming through and leave the place feeling more open

yX15Hskc_zVDhH6FQckWDQ 5 ive been to dean of shadyside on several occasions now i have always had a pleasant experience and often recommend them to my friends they have a great referral program where you can give people a certificate for a free haircut and in return you get 5 off of your next cut the free haircut got me in and now its my regular placei got my last haircut from ken who was great he gave me the type of haircut i wanted while also adding his expertise i loved the way he dried and styled my hair too the staff are all professional and try to make your experience a pleasant one
7Z2LZNkD2q-xhhmxXjQIHQ 3 i had the chicken white pizza that has spinach too its the best white pizza that i have had in oakland so farthis place may seem like a little hole in the wall but the cooks seem to be authentically italian and make great pizza
Y1rvGqVHk_wmmafuoW159Q 5 i thought upmc urgent care shadyside offered great  quick service despite being walkin only i didnt wait more than 10 minutes to be seen the staff was friendly helpful and ran the place efficiently
h6uJHpVqLlkJJCRxPNhKFg 5 the employees at the genius bar were extremely friendly and helpful i spilled something on my laptop less than a month after i purchased it and they felt really badthey didnt charge me the 755 that it was supposed to cost as a one time exception
Tzh-u5ueYxEx-k2RAXe7cQ 1 i came here for lunch and was rather disappointed with both the service and the foodwe were a large party of 8 but the restaurant was not very busy and service was still slow the waitress had to be asked multiple times to bring napkins etc and didnt really check in even getting the check and getting out was slowthe food took a long time to come out i had the pulled pork tacos and was very disappointed they were so greasy and didnt have a ton of flavor i got the bottom of the barrel fries which did not impress eitheri wanted to like this place but would not recommend it based on my experience
sYjzwdQWAshVPtLV1JhwVw 3 i love these hot sandwiches it is a big rtion that i can rarely finish in one sitting if you eat in you also get fries for freethe service is pretty quick although they do get quite busy at lunch time the sandwiches come out hot and to order i usually get the pittsburgh cheesesteak with ltmo and always enjoy it they also offer adding an egg which can be yummyhighly recommend for a delicious hot sandwich at lunch or dinnernegatives the restaurant itself looks kinda rundown from the furniture to the floors to the poor lighting although they seem to be going for an old look it could really use a facelift they only take cash they have a atmlike machine to get cash but it will charge you for the transaction wish they were open late
6XBWY3acF8I9wj-AkymxNQ 5 love this place especially our waitress ask for luanna every time she always makes sure everything is perfect even special requests for our kids great food great family atmosphere and great service
9_psbS_onqVI55rg9jnUhw 3 my goodness me its a regular dump on los sombreros festival here in yelpland hey people  its a perfectly fine mexican restaurant well maybe its not perfect but my meals here over the past five years have always been good and i consider los sombreros a great place to take outoftown guests if i were to grade it on a pretentiousness scale it actually rates better and is more inviting than barrio cafe so give the place a break  try the guacamole the chicken mole the lamb adobo any of the skirt steak entrees and any of the seafood dishes
Cpcq-VoLl6kYCHI4EkpwxA 3 i am recommending this place on behalf of a relative who was looking for an unusual flower arrangement for a special occasion and walked away with exactly what he wanted glad to know this little place exists in my neighborhood
heZ9UDQrPobXAO2Nz1IJQw 3 my husband and i dined here twice within one week to seek solace after spending a lot of time in the expo store down the way where we were setting the wheels in motion for a huge kitchen remodel happy to report that our enchiladas and tacos provided sufficient comfort the sauces are especially distinctive and good there will be one more visit to expo after which im sure ill head in the same direction  and add a double margarita to my order
To7LDB_nCpi10qH1k0pTKg 3 giving four stars to china chili doesnt necessarily mean i think the place is fantastic  but the spicy garlic eggplant is fantastic and im still pondering its fantasticness hours later my husband and i also enjoyed the rest of our meal  yiushan chicken and one of the house specialties black pepper prawns and scallops yes i concur with other reviewers that some of the dishes are not gonna be fantastic still i look upon the place as reliable clean moderately priced and efficient i dont need pf changs
sSC3rXCHNGt3XoMaOPQ1Ig 3 maybe the four stars is too generous after just one visit but theres something about this place thats very comforting maybe its the community seating or the simple white bowls your veggies come in or maybe its the simple fact that youre eating your veggies and enjoying them too i tried a yummy coconut curry with crispy tofu and appreciated that it was just the right portion for the price im gonna try a vegan tsoynami with vegan tsoft tserve ice cream spelling is correct next time i go
LEue5VYkm0lz5dLdQ73C7w 3 through unusual circumstances i ate at three thai restaurants within 24 hours the other day  bejarong thai in mesa for dinner thai lahna for lunch the next day and malees thai bistro for dinner that evening and the winner is  good ol dependable thai lahna i realize though that i am in a bit of a rut as to what i order there and need to branch out to some of their seafood and vegetarian entrees before i can call myself a thai food aficionado also my far eastern journey led to the pleasant discovery of bejarong which comes in second malees  i appreciate your twists on thai food but my halfplate entree was not worth the 9 i paid for it
KRtCR7EZdvzJy165N2xHwA 3 it was back in the 80s when town and country shopping center was a hoppin place on weekend nights because of its great selection of trendy restaurants maybe those heydays are gone but as someone from the neighborhood i am glad to see a few small boutique restaurants going in and cyprus pita grill might well start drawing more crowds the food is carefully prepared and presented the atmosphere is cute faux greek and the service is pleasant the lamb on my gyro plate was tender and scrumptious and i regret i didnt order any appetizers a neighboring table was ordering all appetizers instead of entrees and they looked wonderful three of us sated ourselves for a mere 45 and resolved to stop by more often
vzF3nIpVwbNASmsOhtan5w 3 el molino makes the chimichanga by which i rate all other chimichangas  if another restaurant doesnt give it  just the right crispiness with just the right accompaniments of cheese guacamole and sour cream then it just doesnt cut it by the way after almost 30 years in phoenix ive eaten more chimichangas than i care to admit get el molinos chicken or machaca chimi which is often a nightly special for under 8 and you will be in sinusclearing chimi heaven
pUbgWISyOHd61qpSra0QoQ 3 previous reviews make a lot of good points but i disagree that the food is bland try the house specialties the soups and the spring rolls i had not been in for a few years and was pleasantly surprised on my visit last night as to how busy it was this is good value and quality for an area of central phoenix where good restaurants are scarce and dont dis the desserts  theyre terrific
uuA49nD83C-Uo3kPJprOAA 3 must echo brian o about the lack of circulation in the booth area not good when the temp is 113 degrees no matter how many times the server refills your water by the way our service was good and efficient and we liked the guacamole prepared tableside also we liked the many vegetarian options and the way the shrimp tacos were prepared i hardly ever venture out to glendale but at least now i know of a decent mexican restaurant there
TX9FFKsImwxBTgeFD1wIKw 3 i feel like part of the incrowd whenever i dine at barrio cafe this is good and bad good because i realize as hordes of other people do that this is some of the most innovative mexican food in town bad because tonight i realized the incrowd often is in its lust for a good meal downright rude one set of patrons muscled its way to the front of the line as the restaurant geared up for its 5 pm saturday opening i mean really just get in line then once we were dining we noticed another set of patrons coming in the back door and just seating themselves at an empty table the waitperson to her credit remained polite toward them sigh im trying a week night next time 
FLDfPPwifbeFf4WUueMrVQ 1 i would agree that the food and pastries here are above average but when i walk into a small crowded noisy place and dont know where to go for a simple beverage and no employee seems to notice my perplexity or to care i come away feeling the place is pretentious snobby confusing and out of my league which is too bad because its right in my neighborhood i sense that if youre a regular here then probably you feel welcome and the employees chat you up all time but not all of us can afford to be regulars here this is at least the third time that la grande oranges uppity ambience has annoyed me so i dont feel guilty about the poor review
VmXe_b1kA-Fq-JAol6--7Q 3 this is better than average mall food and i love the cookies and muffins there oughta be a yellow caution tape around the establishment though because its ultracentralized location forces way too many cream cheese brownie breaks and those clothes im trying on are not gonna fit me after all i do have to wonder if the portions for salads and sandwiches are getting smaller a customer next to me griped about it to the cashier and lo and behold my tasty pasta salad was a little on the chintzy side
44SM6MM8LYuvC8-YUTYmMA 3 beware the ladies of teavana i say this goodnaturedly but also as a warning let me say first that as a tea freak i love that this place exists and now i can go to either the biltmore or scottsdale fashion square location but heres what happened to me and i repeat it here as a warning i walked by the store with no intention of going in thirsty i sampled a tea by the door then another tea then i thought what the heck  i walked a few feet into the store and sampled another tea thats when a lady of teavana snagged me chatting quite knowledgeably about the tea i was tasting and inviting me like a siren to get a whiff from a tea canister at the counter expertly she fanned the lid of the canister over the leaves so that i could get the full effect oh my that orangepomegranatewhatever smelled good must i take some home oh yes i must that lovely 8ounce canister of herbal tea will be 36 please yikes
-8nLvWne0z6tNoW56OD1Ig 3 im no seafood aficionado but this place seemed pretty good to me and i hope it sticks around because fresh seafood like this and at these prices is fairly unusual here in the desert our table tried the fish and chips swordfish seafood kebab and catfish  and all were satisfied as noted in other reviews the staff is jovial and the atmosphere is pleasant whew  saves me a trip to boston
nQ3lsNgUAN84gcSCqG5X6A 3 seems like the menu has been overhauled since i last dined here a couple of years ago but nbd we skipped the appetizers knowing that our entrees would be plenty filling the tasty appetizer selection is worth considering though if youre at flos with a fairly big party we liked all of our dishes  the spicy bean curd the shrimp and panfried noodles and the chicken vindaloo with the latter being maybe the weakest of the bunch with it being early and uncrowded on a hot and humid evening the wait staff was friendly and very attentive try out this location before the snowbirds return
gWswIKI1qty3cN1rluzLsQ 3 im trying to decide  when it comes to pizza am i a crust person or a topping person if i am the latter then i would say that the toppings we tried on three different pizzas were all good but could have been more plentiful we especially liked the artichoke and olive pizza whatever exotic cheeses the chefs put on the pizzas are terrific but are just dotted on i left the restaurant last night feeling crusty which is to say i love the woodfired slightly burned softontheinside crust so much so that i almost finished off the crust left on my carbwatching daughters plate well see where things fall in the great crusttopping dilemma next time i visit
2EcmxPM7tvWVD7teiRBwgQ 3 lovely decor good location celebrity tiein  and food that left me wishing i had ordered something different out of our party of four two of us ordered mediocre dishes  the vegetarian chile relleno and the chicken mole casserole but the two other dishes were fine  spinach and mango salad and chicken enchiladas suiza the chunky salsa was also quite good especially for those of us whove deprived ourselves of tomatoes recently let this be a lesson to you and me read reviews on yelp for recommendations on a new restaurants best dishes before you go also a note to our server when a customer says his dish is just ok then doh  follow up by asking how it could be better this is especially necessary at a new place
AcqEzHvTgEIoijwzQPCzpg 3 when we found out we had to spend the night in las vegas because of a cancelled flight to europe we surely hadnt foreseen a night at the tropicana that old place but it turned out fine and im glad we were there after the remodel from the sounds of the before we walked through the excalibur and boy does that place need to be brought out of the middle ages as for the trop id like to put in a good word for the buffet at cafe nikki it was simple and almost elegant and not what we expected from a buffet on the strip the cafe has a beach theme which keeps things light and modern everything we tried tasted good or good enough and the desserts were crazy good i appreciated that the chefs were hovering behind the buffet table every time i went up  it showed me they cared
N6O4676V0weTsGdsVuap-w 3 have you ever had one of those experiences where you saunter out of a restaurant after your first visit there and you think gee not bad  ill be back and then the next day you mention the restaurant to friends and they shoot you down not such a great place after all they convince you well in hindsight i see that my friend was right about the food here being on the bland side yes it does seem to be prepared with your arteries in mind but what is indian food without creamy richness and sweatinducing spice i give bombay spice kudos for the innovative plating and for allowing you to order two entrees for the price of one the happy hour is a terrific idea and i might be back just for the 4 appetizers and wine
iHfPcaTIAvdfOuScT1__vw 3 i get the feeling that little ol chop and wok  with its bar area drink menu and kitschy tropicalbeach bum decor  is gearing up to be a twentysomethings hangout at night and thats just fine but ill keep going for the quieter hours and the lunch specials when the traditional chinese chicken and vegetable dishes are all i need two tips try the crab puffs which have been a chop and wok specialty for years and park in the back instead of trying to maneuver in and out of a space from the busy intersection of scottsdale and shea
0T1xa_tY4Yb-39uYA9tdGw 3 ordered a mediterranean salad expected green leafy lettuce received iceberg dressing was very salty very underwhelmed the place was clean and the gentlemen taking the orders was very nice
kHN8zrGfWKu_2OjgmPgrKQ 3 this musical isnt going to win any tony awards but if you are a fan of the evil dead movies youll enjoy it but only if you get the splatter zone like the movies the musical is packed full of campy humor and gore which is exactly why you love the movies the songs lyrics are at most times over powered by the music but i would have to say my favorite one was wtfthis reminded me of community theater with a few surprisingly good singers terrible props and uncomfortable seats i found it really funny that you could all ready see the tears and faded blood stains from past performances on their clothes from the very start my group did the splatter zone and we loved it they get you from all sides but mostly it came from the back right with the spaltter zone you get vip seating 2 for 1 bar drinks and a white evil dead tshirtthe odd thing about the blood was it was warm i never did get use to thatif youve seen all 3 movies you will have fun however it does take a moment to get into here are a few things to think aboutdont go if you think this is going to be scary its notdont go if you are offended by swearing they do it a lotdont go if you hate campy movies with cult followingsdont go if you never seen any of the evil dead moviesdont go if you hate musicalsdont go if you dont want to get pinkish water coloring on your clothes it can get on you even if you arent in the spatter zone mainly the first and second row behind the vip areadont go because someone talked you into it you wont like it we saw a few couplesgroups not come back after the second act because someone was whining they wanted to godo goif you love the evil dead moviesif you have an open mindif you are willing to gamble 4070 dollars on something you may not likeif you quoting the popular movie lines with the actors the crowd was shouting these lines it was a great vibethe key is to expect the worst thats what i did and i had fun
csA2vYbyo-byZrjermZsVw 5 one of my favorite restaurants hamds down the martinis are amazing jolly rancher the salads and antipesto are so tasty i always love the cozy feeling in tge winter and the hot patio with ferry lights in the summer great staff and amazing location
VBKndA5tubsA8k4gQmKPJQ 3 the food was pretty good  great atmosphere and crowd but the waitress with the dark brown hair was rude and our food waited for her on the counter for 20minutes before givibg it to us so it was very cold her attitude was negative  she rushed out orders and the orange juice is gross
GtEe-h_-s5Va_HXrwLYvrQ 3 decent haircut not so good shave classic barber chairs at big mirrors in gold painted wooden frames sitting on what look like antiqueshop dressers but they all match so probably not plus photos of james dean the rat pack and laurel  hardy  and classic rock on the radio nice enough surroundingshad trouble communicating with my barber whose english was limited simple questions were met with blank looks we managed but not without difficulty the haircut was fine not that i needed anything out of the ordinary oddly the shampoo followed the cut so he was working with somewhat dirty hairthe hot towel shave was a real disappointment first the chairs do not recline at all so there is no sense of relaxation you either sit up straight and strain your neck to bend your head back or slide forward in the chair and strain your back the hot towel is perfunctory the shave was unpleasant and sometimes painful and my barber left three nicks on my neck the cucumber gel afterward was a welcome finish
nzdrfYMfd1DrPvv54WeWgQ 3 let me get the one big negative out of the way nowhere in the place are prices shown not anywhere not on the menu board not on the counter or the display case or on any kind of sign sure people who own homes in baby point can ignore such trivialities but not the rest of us more transparency pleaseotherwise we love this spot bright airy and mostly comfortable except for those metal stools with exceptional coffee fascinating and unusual beverages i tried the tumeric latte most recently and a great philosophy about environmental respect and quality productlocation is a bit out of the way but while not especially convenient for us we go anyway the video screen with updated bus information is a great ideariders can grab a coffee without worrying about missing their ride wifi seems good music is listenable and faces are friendlywe are looking forward to future visits just let us know the prices okay
ON_NF7kkZRKo1hIwIL45zQ 1 they rarely answer their phone in fact most times you cannot even leave a voicemail they responded to emails most of the time but we had to ask every question three times before their responses actually answered anything trying to schedule an appointment was nuts when the day finally arrived nobody showed up no notice of cancellation no apology afterwards
NDZfcUiDMAgslZdiO0k1IA 3 the good sparkling bathroom and some but far from all excellent cleaning elsewherethe notsogood despite my emphasis on dusting the tops of picture frames and other obvious surfaces were untouched despite my asking for a protective cover over the bed while dusting the ceiling fan above they dusted right over the bedding other specific requests which i wrote down for them were forgotten or ignored even though a total time for cleaning was arranged they managed the time badly taking over an hour on one small room wasting time on blinds and making the bed i approved an extra hour but they went beyond that too without my approvaland of course charged me for it finally sharing these and other concerns with the company resulted in thanks for your thoughts no adjustment apology or explanation
pkZMvOBI_r5INxO9MqpVbw 5 just visited this candy store excellent selection and very sweet employees thank you for an excellent experience
63JzFnnn9zhXrLltcB4udA 1 in the past ive found them to have a decent selection with fairly good quality but have been annoyed at their unwillingness to sell smaller filets  today however i bought some cod which turned out to be absolutely foul when i got home about 20 minutes after leaving the store  i wont go back
QrngGCyikPc3y3w4lUcGNA 3 this is some of the better sushi in toronto but thats unfortunately not saying much  i had takeout from japango this evening ordering only specials yellowtail uni and horse mackerel  the yellowtail was good the uni excellent but the horse mackerel was dried out and gave off the smell of tooold fish and yes i know that mackerel is an oily fishy fish even when fresh  the ohitashi side dish featured spinach which hadnt been washed  plenty of crunchy dirtsand in there   ill wait til i go to vancouver nyc seattle or chicago to have sushi again
yGTiD0iifQmgUEvlElZTug 1 i rarely get sick and when i do i always get better rather quickly so me going to statclinix on tuesday july 7 was a big deal i had been having trouble swallowing due to a major sore throat i kept getting the cold sweats and could not sleep at night due to a cough and would gasp for air after 2 hours at the clinic dr greg reser said nothing was wrong and to keep taking overthecounter meds i told him nothing had been working and that i was headed out of town soon so wanted to treat this before it turned into anything big to that he said come back in 3 days if you arent better i mentioned to him in 3 days i would be gone for 3 weeks which he chose to blatantly ignore so here we are 2 days later and i now have white spots on my tonsils  a major sign of strep which is common in my family i just got off the phone with the clinic and they said there is a different doctor i could go see today i asked how much that would cost and they could not answer why would i return to a place that appears to be scamming people for their money it shouldnt be this hard to receive meds that are desperately needed if you are feeling ill i beg you to go elsewhere rather than waste your money here
6w95rMg1d2PpPUZXy4rqSQ 3 its a decent airport i travel mostly domestically so i dont have a large sample pool to pull from they seem to have the proper amount of retail stores to meet the consumers needs and have helpful vendors once you have checked in
hxLcWgJ7etP9AWu46wXJlQ 1 customer service is important so my advice to the girl that served me is to remove your headphones while at work sad

aoIgt2l0-Df1ADnrjdtQXw 5 stop searching bill is going to be your home inspector i rarely review but i had to find my login again just to put in this review for fyi home inspectionsi did my research with a good number of home inspectors and it was just obvious when calling them they give you the marketing pitch trying to appease you when i called bill he was straight up and the real deali am a buyer who was looking for a new home to live in i had some unfortunate circumstances arise on my home inspections and bill went above and beyond in his service to accommodate my situations because he really does care his inspections are thorough and accurate he finds everything that can be a problem with the house trust me i did more than one inspection with him its pretty crazy if you join him in the inspection to see how good he is i thank bill for the professionalism and quality of service that he has provided me i will definitely recommend him to everyone and use him again if i need to do a home inspection really i rarely do reviews just this morning my dentist office asked me to do a quick review on their computer and i was like nah the lady got mad bill was so excellent that it made me want to review him here
yR-eN8-u4FTHIaaZgccLtw 3 extremely overpriced for the amount of food you get i used to go here all the time the food was delicious what changed was the portion of food most places increase prices when they need to not this place no what they did here is a disgusting disservice to the customer they instead lessened the portion of the food by more than twice it was its less than the kids portion compared to some places yes so now if you want the similar portion that you had before then you have to pay for it twice i think it would still be less than what one portion was though which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced for example the last time i went here i had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam i asked for no beef and replace with more spam this is what i usually used to get so you know what they gave me 2 tiny pieces of spam the chicken portion was also minuscule and a tiny scoop of rice too not even a whole scoop i eat at many places in vegas and around the country as i travel all the time i mostly use yelp to give great reviews for amazing places that need more attention from customers this place though i logged in for the first time in a long time to give this one star review it is that bad compared to what they used to be it is way more expensive than every manhattan nonwaiter place i have been to along with chicago boston seattle miami toronto etc guys if this portion issue has changed please let me know i will then try it again and see for myself and update my review accordingly i used to love this place but now it just still gets me mad when i think about what i paid for and then gotupdate may 2017i want back again to see if they changed anything i went back again to see if it was a fluke it looks like they did raise the portions not as big as it used to be but this is much better then before where i gave a one star review food was still delicious
vLCqQ50Cucf0LcDzKtk4iA 5 great laothai food curries are amazing many of the other dishes are excellent as wellthe seats at the sides of the restaurant are pretty ripped up they need to fix that
KgWry2oAWljXNnE26hE0jA 3 this place a a regular bland typical thai restaurant now not nearly as good as it used to be with the previous owners
nISrNg37MlUFaa54-dQi9g 5 burgers better than innout fatburger or any place i have ever been to the burritos are good and the pizza is really good try their mushroom pizza it is greatdont listen to what these pansy weenies say this area is not unsafe at all even at night
O16km1usO6K52QKxZ48wIQ 5 this is great authentic japanese curry i have been going here for a while and it is delicious every time i mainly eat the chicken cutlet or the curry udon i went to japan a few months ago and had curry several times while there specifically tokyo like around shinjuku and akihabara i have eaten here before going to japan and it was awesome but now that i have been to japan i can say that it is authentic it wasnt too far from how delicious the curry was in japan the owner is a cool guy too i think i remember him saying he is from akihabarahere in vegas you probably wont find a japanese curry as good as here so take advantage
GO3eSfGkvlEikgnGL4f0PA 5 best chinese food in this side of town almost everything is great their takeout and delivery is extremely fast the only dish that is not great is the pad thai it is pretty bad to be honest other than that though the quality of the food surpasses any other chinese place around here price is more like 1 and a half s
CBS_895f1shcQyN7QuSHoA 5 good food fresh ingredients well prepared the pho has a wonderful broth and the spring rolls were some of the best ive had comfortable environment friendly staff good value
WzhRF_zgUuzNWYFTBiPfww 5 i purchased a short sale property in equestrian and needed a very reliable and thorough inspector to make sure i knew what i was getting into i had used tim oneall once before so i gave him a call he was extremely professional arrived on time discussed rates and services up front and then an absolutely amazing and thorough job inspecting my potential home armed with a book of information from the major ac units to the minor cracked switch plates bad doorbell provided by tim i was able to negotiate a better price on my house and more importantly to know exactly what i was getting into weve been here for over 2 years now and i can honestly say that i probably would not have made the leap had i not been armed with the confidence that tims inspection and report provided me i would and have recommend tim to anyone in phoenix who ever needs a home inspection

Hx0RiVudkDxHhVlmV8LDAg 5 great food and excellent service the chirashi bowl was well presented and filling fish was bold colored and fresh tasting the clam hot pot was more than enough food for one person with plenty of clams the meatball and chicken skewers were crispy and tender the pork was very good as well but a little tougher than the chicken and meatballs warm and comfortable ambience attentive and pleasant service and very good food cant wait to come back and try other dishes
