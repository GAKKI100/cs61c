kT6oKXiD9PbXNV2YiqNgyA 1 ive been going here for a while regularly but lately i havent seen the owner and it seems like theyve endlessly been rotating deadbeat employees through there theyre screwing up a ton of orders and they oftentimes dont know the specials or how to run the registernot to mention theyre unprofessional this place is going downhill quick and its a shame
qKAazjV3FO3GkKabrkEvFw 1 is it just me or does the staff at trax farms have a terrible attitude dont get me wrong its not everyone therebut in general everyone just seems so miserable in my experience the staff usually reflects the attitude of managementownershipso that cant be a good sign ive been going there since i was a toddler  ive been there more recently because we moved into the area im so disappointed not only is it expensive which i was willing to deal with but now i have to deal with a snooty staff that seems annoyed by every interaction or order maybe its because trax is now out of the farmingcustomer service business and more into the gasoil business oh well simmons and bebout are right up the road and theyre definitely more welcoming
2wu0XQ8vzpsKyrEOwLkjdw 1 my wife recently took our puppy to brush run animal clinic and the vet there told my wife to feed our puppy milo any of the dog foods in the grocery storethe natural foods out there are just a scam uhhh really milo just went in for vaccinations and they gave him rabies dap and lepto all at oncethen sent her on her way no warnings no what to look forjust collect their  and send you on your way after observing milo being lethargic and reading about what may becausing the discharge from his eyes formaldehydemercury in the 58 vaccines that he received at once ive decided to research other vets in the area and take our puppy elsewhere
ShOi4adb5lglrvqCTBrkZw 3 yep it was pretty good the dumplings were by far the best ive ever had they also take creditdebit as well as cash which was really convenient right in the heart of chinatown we got a plate of pork dumplings each and were pretty pleased with our last minute dinner decision would recommend to dumpling snobs

NR6cAGxeL3TA2i3Vvmzc8A 5 awesome hotel super modern very friendly bilingual staff nice location the parking situation in the city is not the best of course but for just a few dollars more than public parking they will valet park your car totally worth it oh and good speedy free wifi we probably wont visit montreal again but if we did we would go back to this hotel great experience
UHalz6MvqToEapEPvYWO9A 5 i still love this sushi house  we visit a couple times a month over the last threeish years and its still awesome  i cant believe were lucky enough to have great sushi in our neighbourhood

kd-nw5djwARVtQqV9GADJw 3 you never know what kind of beer will be on top if you love trying beers you dont see on a regular basis go to beer revolution  the beer list changes right before you eyes  food is a good complement pizza is awesome but you really go here for the beer experience
ltOfDDhp8Yio3tfd1X2aAQ 3 went for hubbys birthday and had a wonderful experience  we had the cold smoked elk carpaccio pickled blueberries first pressed canola  foie gras parfait apple bourbon gele compressed apple to start  excellent choices  im not a pate fan but the foie gras was fabulous  for dinner hubby had the seared halibut white bean and chorizo ragout clams blistered cherry tomato sauce vierge and i had the birch smoked duck breast steel cut oat and mushroom risotto braised red cabbage natural duck jus  absolutely delicious  and we ended with brie cheesecake poppy seed honey raspberry fluid gel  yeah not so much i love brie and i love cheesecake but together not so fabulous  just not my taste i guessall in all a great experience i would definitely repeat

6MWtJqYZV2imBJ9FBM-rfA 1 not pleased with the sneaky upsale  i havent had nails for years and i wanted to treat myself i wanted acrylic but apparently acrylic sounds like uv gel with shellac  they started with acrylic tips and id never had gel before so i didnt know what they were doing until it was too late  wasnt pleased with the gel nails either  super thick and they were totally skimpy with the nail colour  i will never again get gel nails and i certainly wont be back where i dont get what i asked for in the first place  they completely ignored what i asked for and put the most expensive nail service they have on me  it wasnt until i paid that i knew exactly what service i had received  not impressed
CKbSbz5EHZQVNN0N13OLVw 5 yum  ive been searching for a pho spot for awhile now  nothing compares to this place i had the 2rare beef pho and hubby had asate chicken  broth was excellent and flavourful hubby said its the best sate hes ever had and the shredded chicken just melted in his mouth  he loved it so much it brought tears to his eyes  service was wonderful as well  if you love pho you need to come here  do it
4It-13zVL9fNhh8cdRVSXw 5 omg  i used to go for brunch with my mother at the inn at lake bonavista  lets just say ive come home again  i wanted the brunch at the lake house to take me back to all those years of wonderful brunch in a spectacular environment  i was definitely not disappointed  the two different kinds of eggs benny had me giddy  i chose one and my mother chose the other  both are fantabulous  my hubby and stepfather chose the brisket which both spoke very highly of  the blood orange mimosas were fantastic and the sticky toffee pudding was divine  we will definitely be back sooner rather than later  i cant wait to have dinner
hojz-_qNzSCCDq-suZaSXw 5 i love this place  when i have a hankering for the best burrito in town mucho burrito is the only place i go  i usually have a regular barbacoa shredded beef burrito with brown rice black beans sauted veggies and lots of extra cilantro on a whole wheat tortillayum  ive been here several times and im never disappointed
zHSziMhlhlfn-V1zRdHYzA 3 after desperately searching for good pho and reading these reviews i thought id give this little place a try  staff was awesome but the pho and spring rollsnot so much  i always order the rare beef pho wherever i go im not a big fan of fatty beef but i had to order the one with the fatty brisket to get my rare beef  broth was different than ive had before and pretty good  had a nutmeg like taste to it  little disappointed there were no basil leaves to add though  the spring rolls were meh and the shrimp salad rolls were empty  three shrimp some noodles and a sprig of lettuce i mean sprig too  all in all wasnt horrible just meh
TwDpbDMOE8ByK0lnm_-bLQ 5 kildares is our goto pub  its not even in our neighborhood but worth the drive  food is great beer is awesome staff is fabulous  we sit at the bar so our service is always fantastic  i have not experienced the inattentive staff issues mentioned in other reviews  my food is never cold which was also mentioned in other reviews  if it was i would send it back and give them a chance to correct before mentioning it in a review  never had a problem with the service or food  i highly recommend this pub to everyone i meet
pmj_oSfRGZarltVQABWmyQ 5 ive been going to bolsa for a few years now and i just realized ive never written a review for it  i love bolsa i usually get beef pho with a side of spring rolls  yum  but recently ive branched out and tried other things on the menu my favourite so far has to be happys coconut rice  phenomenal  and the homemade hoisin sauce is outstanding  i dont like sweet very much and the sauce has just enough sweet without going overboard  i introduced some friends to bolsa and now it seems bolsa gets picked whenever someone celebrates a birthday  highly recommend bolsa
nEnrnpqxRREnlt2f87OEyw 3 not my favourite pho house but more than adequate  helps its also in one of my favourite shopping areas  my usual is spring rolls and rare beef pho  i never leave unsatisfied and its definitely good value for my money  definitely recommend if good decent pho is what youre craving

Wx8_XUtoyyeaVwbfgVssBg 5 excellent chinese restaurant  food was fast hot and delicious  we had ginger fried beef moo goo gai pan and mushroom fried rice  everything was fantastic  service was great and the bill was decent  lots of pickups while we were eating so the food is definitely popular  i think weve found our new local chinese restaurant
fhhHsaEO-TEkVyojvXJueA 5 we went to avec bistro for our anniversary in june 2013 and it was beyond our expectations the food was fabulous and the service was exceptional  i had the duck and my husband had the lamb both were outstanding  i really dislike lamb but this was so good even i would order the lamb  we had some questions about wine pairings and suggestions given by our waitress were bang on everything about avec bistro gave us such a fantastic meal experience that we will definitely be back soon
QJfA_0kBNbtxIRsfp6jINQ 3 weve had pho at different places all over the city  when i want pho this is where i want to go i dont know their secret but i love the spring rolls and rare beef pho made here nothing else seems to compare for me  we will drive across the city to go here for inexpensive fantastic pho
3Dg6ScfD4LyHNStypoUGbw 3 ive been searching for some decent pho in the south part of calgary  out of all the places ive tried this one is the best by far although still not my favourite  when i get a hankering for rare beef pho with a side of spring rolls this is where ill be goingat least until i find that elusive favourite  still will worth it and the staff is very friendly

_91fcH_RNLDfNVF8HHPOJA 5 i get my 4 yr old chocolate meatballs aka munchkins every 2 weeks or so and weve always had nothing but fast friendly service
OqWTtSaJreN26dMbS8gjVQ 1 went in on a friday night we were seated in a far corner away from everyone else our waitress kept forgetting about us didnt want to get us refills my husbands limeade was nasty and we could see our food sitting in window for the longest time with so many other restaurants in the area we wont go back
u24TWNv9v2GURgTuWs_eZw 1 this was our 4th rainforest cafe we have visited my son picked it for his 5th birthday dinner worst rainforest expierence ever our waitress was very rude our order was incorrect twice and she kept making it worse by screwing it up more i didnt realize a plain cheeseburger was so hard for a 200 bill i didnt realize we would have to beg so much for refills and correct food my son enjoyed it and at the end of the day that was what was important however next year ill talk him into something else
wDDPNOfHd7PNt1NJSvhWAw 5 ive had a po box here since august 2011 the owner has always been super friendly always pulls my packages before i even get to my box great service
9VWrWdzdx2GITrTaOiGMrA 1 the manager is rude my order is never correct it really isnt hard to leave ice out of a drink people the machine does it for you if you ring it up correct 2 out of 3 times my kids food is wrong i now avoid this location
jp0dRTDMjFTcLuT4UjezQw 5 went in for our 2nd visit more people working fast service much better this time around
RR3DMYTGYJZjtMl0bY1qaA 1 we havent been to one in years we were sadly disappointed our burgers were still pretty pink in the middle and with 4 children that was not a good thing fries were cold our food sat in the window for the longest time because they couldnt figure out if our order was ready or not not impressed with the place at all
q97bXo1OQSBdxV7jxQnFag 1 food was just okay no employees were monitoring the games or rides kids were climbing on and spinning on a ride that was broken and a teenage girl ran into my 4 yr old while running around in a circle to spin the broken ride by this time i was extrememly angry and dragged a manager out to tape it up with caution signs we will not go back
x-R2dKw7T9oD8KSf-JjN0g 5 one of our favorite cupcake shops my kids and i love them and we are cupcake snobs
uZummx7_bdkLGFJrUQU_FQ 1 we went in on a wed night hoping theyd be like a steak and shake after sitting in our booth for 15 minutes being ignored we sent one of the kids to the counter asking where to order at another 5 minutes passes and a waiter comes to the table service was slow we had to beg for drink refills 1 of the kids meals was made wrong and my 15 yr old brother ordered bbq wings from the appetizer section and they brought him chicken strips and fries he ate that because he didnt want to wait even longer then we had we wont go back tried it once and that was enough  a shame the food sucks because my husband really liked his shake
AkxFYgrEaLodF8MwMn4h9Q 5 my son loves the splash pad his dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while i can run in the store or two that i need to there are quite a few empty retail spots hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well
irTY1eLOYtqymQXDGDYNFg 5 very wide variety of products staff is very helpful and friendly i was there picking up a present for my kids and the staff was very helpful with showing me everything i would need for the cotton candy machine
I5qgJXvtOP90mGxW-9pEnw 1 went last week and ordered a dozen variety i didnt care for any of them very dry the frosting wasnt very goodeven my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out
kSGa7LDrJ1XoAIl0V3vWNA 5 amy h was great she was very accommodating and willing to give input while keeping your preferences at the forefront of the appointment i received a cut and partial highlights and found the prices extremely reasonable i would definitely be a regular if i didnt live on the east coast
6_l7pMuTfLJQFCLNfkdw1A 3 they do a great job for kids birthday parties  we had the girls party there this weekend at 10am  kids wore pajamas and had a blast  tons of art projects followed by sprinkle donuts  good value and super easy
HfbkGOv16SF4XGrYQWENdA 3 big fan  rarely in town enough to get by as regularly as i used to but i stick the soup for lunch  1 extra spicy  the level of spice is all in the technique of the person serving the soup  my wife loves the hibachi and you cant beat the price  quick service
mgn68vlcCaY7-_g4l3wQig 3 fried pickles and pimiento cheese fries to start for the table  may have been overkill but they were pretty good  burgers were the main entree and hit the spot  small parking lot but service was good
GkCug02cOIGmv9EHFsi4lA 5 my man does it again  have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor  he has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly and repeatedly deliver quality work  highly recommend
SoNJHJCgCQOO4zvE_GKUow 5 tried worth on a whim after seeing other yelp reviews  had the chicken veggie hash for lunch which was amazing  it comes with roasted seasonal vegetables which happened to be sweet potatoes and asparagus  delicious  another bonus is that they offer gluten free options for the sandwiches  any sandwich can be served without bread over a bed of greens and sweet potatoes excluding grilled cheese  give it a try its worth it
TlXaxbTi_1H59YYKQ24KmA 5 great place chris the owner was rock solid the store is relatively small but what it lacks in size it makes up for in product quality and excellent customer service the mattresses and adjustable frames are top notch and the prices are affordable my fiance and i looked pretty much everywhere before stepping foot in mattress 360 im glad we waited sleeping like a log
DSdwAr9iE5dMhMj3bQwaAQ 1 service was great and the food was tasty but i had an experience that left a bad taste in my mouth my bill came out to 23 and some change and i paid cash with two 20 bills when the server came to take my payment he asked if i wanted change really sorry bud it was good but not tipping 75 good then when he brings me my change he kept the coins for himself and gave me only the bills if this is customary at upscale restaurants or those that are trying to be then im not aok with that and thats why im giving lalbatros a 2star rating i wasnt going to make a scene over 70 cents in front of my party but i needed to share this experience so others are aware
t8jcwiMS3u0e7V6sf4k_Cw 3 delicious food and comfortable atmosphere the cafeteriastyle line is different but it made the experience unique the piano player was a nice touch my only complaint is the price tag  they have no servers but the final cost is a bit high for what you get almost as if theyve added in a gratuity anyway 15 cheaper fare would get 5stars from me
bki9-sFKr7zL9VAfJBYb-w 5 old man bar is the best perhaps its not for everyone but there is no better weekday bar than omb weekends can be a different story  during the summers the clientele tends to be 30to40something guidos on friday and saturday night  but for the rest of the week its a great place to drink mike and keith are funny friendly and generous best bartenders ever
pe3CdngIPi5Yj3wD-V7vqw 3 lots of choices on tap for beers for good prices they also change out their selections pretty regularly food is iffy the corned beef hash is the diamond in the rough and a strange smell emanates from this place bartenders are pretty friendly
2M8BmNI744o33z-EHsGveQ 1 party of two but didnt get noticed until over 20 minutes after we got seated and the food took well over an hour to reach us the food was good but not worth the wait or the price tag the problem is the management  only one waitress worked the entire floor on a weekend evening she had a couple bussers to help but it wasnt enough unless i hear that things have changed ill never go back
sVcerwmoBFgwXpB0KRhBqA 3 ive been to falafel at various times and days but the service remains consistently good it usually takes just over 5 minutes for me to get my meal and never more than 10 the cost for a full meal  eg a bowl of soup a sandwich and a drink  is pretty good 10 and they have daily specials which are even cheaper ive not had a bad experience heremy only complaints albeit minor are a that the sandwich wraps tend to be a little juicygreasy for my liking b they generally wont bring you refills unless you go to the front counter or ask them as they walk through the dining room
nPYZRvOFxoN3xcg3jEPeOA 3 many good things to say about zanzibar my exposure to their entire menu is limited but what i had was delicious you have to get the walleye cakes their chicken and cornbread is also very good the koolaid is overpriced but it is deliciousthe waitstaff was professional and the atmosphere is very relaxedprice tag is pretty good considering the amount and quality of the food you getmy only complaint is the speed of service but i havent been there enough times to really deduct points because of it may have been isolated incidencesedit ive been a few more times and the speed or service hasnt really changed they dining room temperature is also a little too toasty for my liking food is still delicious though
Sn2kBsxL3LMyfPNdOdkQoQ 3 i had the weiner schnitzel and my girlfriend had the gypsys cutlet it was good not great i have to deduct points for inattentive servers and expensive fare 43 for two people  just too much also they feel the need to remind you several times via their menu that it costs them money to accept credit cards  come on they also automatically threw on a 15 gratuity ok experience but i probably wont be returning
FrbgYH9yL3g8GaIkNefLDg 1 not childfriendly in childfriendly leslieville  after walking 1 hour to get our baby to sleep looking forward to a quiet lunch  a pint at the completely empty roy their bartender watched as i struggled to get my stroller through two heavy doors before informing me that actually we dont allow strollers in the restaurant ie we hate children   still hungry thirsty and welldeserving of a babybreak we backtracked to longstanding leslieville institution velvet and were warmly received    btw i parked my baby stroller next to the owners scooter by the back booth
XG9vnDa1BejZSXlP327qRA 1 so i really dont want to give this place two stars bc this really doesnt reflect the food but i have to bc the service is sooooo slow we had made a reservation for 9 and got there around 830 and they were able to seat us after about 10 minutes our waitress came over pretty quickly after we sat down but then it just went downhill from there we had ordered drinks and the waitress brought my friend the wrong beer we then ordered edamame and a bunch of sushi cut rolls we were really hungry bc we had just traveled to vegas and went straight to dinner from the airport we ordered the spicy tuna salmon avocado shrimp tempura and spicy scallop rolls it then took about 45 mins to get our rolls and we were starving we ate those rolls pretty fast once they got to the table we were still hungry so for some reason we thought it would be a good idea to get some more rolls bad idea the next set of sushi rolls took another hour we almost wanted to cancel the order bc it was taking so long we were hungry but also tired and just wanted to get out of there after we finally got the second set of sushi rolls we immediately asked for our bill bc we knew that would take a while which we were right about after about another 20 minutes we were able to pay our bill and leave as far as the sushi goes it was really good our favorite was the shrimp tempura our least favorites were the spicy scallop and tuna bc they were not spicy the whole meal lasted almost 25 hours which is pretty ridiculous not sure if i would go back bc i dont think i have the patience
gRGhMFih4nw1QxrowdDXHg 5 we wanted to get married by an elvis for our vegas wedding and we were referred to roland by where we were getting married dennys and he was great  he was very nice and took the time to incorporate some things he had just learned about us into the ceremony  his elvis impersonation was great and his singing was really good  i would definitely recommend him
9gsBL6yd_SYX4qZVYpHSwA 3 i made a reservation for a friends birthday and went through the bellagio concierge  i had tried to make my reservation on the restaurant website but it said i had to call  i should have done it through opentable bc i never have problems with them  the concierge had told me the dress was business casual and men cannot wear shorts but when we were seated i saw plenty of men wearing shorts so that was a little irritating our dinner was great though  i had ordered a dirty martin but there was barely any olive juice in it so i asked for more on the side  for our appetizer we got the charcuterie board which was so good  the pickles were the best part they also give you really good bread and olive tapenade which was excellentfor my entree i had the seafood risotto which was so good  i probably shouldnt have eaten all the bread because i was getting really full but i managed to eat almost all of my entree  i also tried the tenderloin which was excellent  my friends also ordered the scallops for their meal which they say was really good as wellwe were really full for dessert but we were celebrating a birthday so we somehow ordered 3 desserts for 5 people  they did put a candle on one of the desserts so that was nice  we tried the banana tiramisu the chocolate peanut butter lava cake and the cookie butter creme brulee  all of which were wonderful  we couldnt stop eating even though we were so stuffed  overall the dinner was great and i definitely recommend this place
rFBdmWyNsQ9la9C8T5Fl4A 1 we wanted something somewhat quick and thought this cafe would be good  there was about a 510 min wait for a table and we were seated with a really good view of the pool area  then it went downhill from there  it took forever to put in a drink order and then once we got it the drinks werent even right  we ordered 3 mimosas and one bloody mary and she brought 2 bloody marys and 2 mimosas except the mimosas were just champagne  once we ordered our food it took forever to get the food  then when she did bring it she gave some of our things to another table and then we had to wait for her to bring out new stuff  even through all of that the food was just ok  i would just avoid this place and go somewhere else
2ZS-43y5za6-ksXtk5jiPg 5 our friends who live in las vegas recommend we go here to meet them for brunch on sunday  i was able to make a quick and easy reservation on opentable and even changed it a few times without any problemswe were seated really quickly and had the best waitress named darlene  were waiting for 3 people in our group and while we waited darlene brought us complimentary pigs in a blanket  we also wanted mimosas and she suggested the bottomless so we can try different kinds and kept bringing us different varietiesthe lunch menu did look good but the brunch menu looked so good we had to go with that  its basically small plates and you all share  theres so much to choose from that darlene said she will take control and bring us almost everything  and she wasnt lying  we had so much food we felt bad wasting stuff when we were getting so full  everything was fantastic  the one thing that we thought would be good was the churro tots  they were a bit underwhelming but still good  we were celebrating two birthdays and darlene even sang to our table  she was so funny and attentive and everyone should have her as their waiter  i will tell everyone that goes to vegas to go here because it was great
q7C9MbAr7xZfX6huP1ic7w 1 my friend was getting married in las vegas over the memorial day holiday and instead of having everyone spend a fortune at the fancy strip hotels she picked the tuscany so everyone was able to get a good ratei was traveling with another one of my friends and her husband and we got to the hotel around 2 pm  we waited in line to check in and asked if we could check in early  we were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed even though we booked them about a year in advance  that makes no sense whatsoever  we told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms but they still didnt care  when they said they had 2 rooms available the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay  we told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be readywe came back exactly an hour later only to be told they werent ready yet  the lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean  they also had one room with a king bed and one room with 2 doubles even though my friend and i had both booked rooms with king beds  i let her have the king room but once again whats the point of reserving a room if you arent going to get what you asked formy room was okay  i didnt have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe  i did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running  that was really loud  also even though there are shades to keep the light out it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than i wanted toafter the first day my room was not cleaned by 300 pm  when i was getting ready to meet my friends the cleaning lady came back around 330 pm and i told her i will be leaving soon and to come back  on the day i was leaving she knocked on my door at 900 am to see when she could clean my room and i told her i was leaving today  shouldnt she know thatthe food at the mexican restaurant and marilyns cafe was just soso  we only ate there bc there was noting else but it wasnt that great  i would have gone somewhere else if there was something else close bythe bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasnt for the jazz music  im not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it  also the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous  my friend and i ordered shirley temples which consist of sprite and cherry flavor and they cost 4 each  what the heck  also a small bottle of water about half the size of a regular bottle was 4  that is so ridiculousthe pool was probably the only thing that wasnt that bad  we were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool  i know people i was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders  she was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people  on my last day i had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool  i went into the bathroom to change and i came out and put my stuff on the counter  the cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look so i asked her if i was in her way  she rudely said yes and i asked her if i should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying something about coming back  so uncalled forwhen it was time to leave we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 1015 mins until he called for one which of course made us late to get to the airporti definitely wont be staying at this hotel again  i appreciate that my friend picked a  place to help all the wedding guests save money but it was an awful experience
3t6FzObtPNi1-uendgdGog 3 we ate at fiamma before going to see cirque de soleils ka at mgm  we made reservations for 645 pm and they were able to seat us right awaythe table was right by the entrance and my seat was right behind the menu where people walking by could check it out  i didnt really like that table bc a lot of people were walking by and then they were right next to the table looking at the menuother than that the food was excellent  they gave us bread and olive oil which was so good bc we had two basketfulls  i ordered the sea bass and a side of potatoes and was completely stuffed  i also had a glass of wine which was great  the restaurant is definitely pricey and it would have been nice if it was a bit cheaper
bXpV7gJjmvBNttndovoifQ 3 my review is for the wedding services they provide  when my nowhusband and i found out that we could get married at dennys we decided that we had to do it  i received excellent service once i was put in touch with sheila the manager  she explained to me what i options i could choose from and we went from there  in the beginning we had chosen the cheapest option but we were upgraded because we had a special guest musician perform for us  the upgrades were great  the flower bouquet and boutonniere was so pretty  the cake pops were delicious and the set up looked great  we had also wanted an elvis minister so they put us in touch with one and he was fantastic  i would definitely recommend getting married at dennys if you are thinking about getting married in vegas
V-vZapSAXUj7ZKhdmuILcA 5 love the atmosphere here great place to hang out before dinner we were pleasantly surprised to find out there is a brand new delicious food menu will be returning soon
HIA38j_7e8Ahj7R9HLUEXg 3 great service although i hd add to go through a couple of stylists before finding one that got my hair cut how i wanted
fGxBVW04PM1HhdRBKixH1w 3 im not a big coffee drinker but their breakfast bagels are amazing i always go with the farmhouse plain bagel and maple smear its like a home made breakfast in a sandwich the staff are always nice and when they makes the occasional mistake they get out fixed within a minute or two highly recommend
_1OnA8k88AjEaqStHIQphA 5 you always know what youre getting at rudys great service great food and a really laid back atmosphere there always something on the tv and great music playing at just the right volume
VnKBt_4E6dbqkGdeHVbz9g 5 even though we went in not long before closing they were very helpful and took the time to answer all our questions the return policy is great we bought a greens supplement that tasted like horse pellets smell and they gave us a complete refund very friendly and very knowledgeable
7cAPWuKt9g3DmQ_L1cE_TA 5 was in the area doing some shopping and decided i needed to eat was going to hit one of the old standbys in the immediate area and noticed this place was up for something new so gave it a try dan was behind the counter and i told him i had never been here he gladly have me a quick but informative rundown of the menu and a couple recommendations i ended up going with the kalua pork rice bowl and couldnt have been more pleased a mostly sweet dish with just the right amount of savory place was very clean and the menu was very simple to navigate they have a selection of hot and soy sauces to add to your dish but i didnt find them necessary in the plethora of asian style places these days this is a definite standout
__vzxaNMRj1p2PH2dJgjAQ 3 went last week during the happening gourmand  from the fixed menu i chose the garlic escargot angus beef bavette and crme brle  given narcisse was the least expensive of the happening gourmand restaurants i was pleasantly satisfied with the meal   in fact out of the 3 hg restaurants we tried narcisse was my favorite  the standouts for me were the escargots   nice twist on traditional escargots with cheese meltedthe beef bavette  inexpensive but well prepared piece of meatthe french fries  savory and lots of themthe service was a tad on the slow side but i think it was more to do with our waitress than systemic of the restaurant
9U-sJBLtm1USA9uqnJV6sw 3 ive eaten here several times now  really enjoyed the ramen  large bowls brimming with tasty goodness   note some bowls have more meat and toppings than othersgyozas are also very good and appear to be made in restaurant as opposed to the frozen bought variety  chicken wings were also very good however last time they came undercooked  ill give that a pass as until that dish everything has been great  very attentive servicewill be back again
O5aYyci-fHtpyIenJf2-rQ 1 if youre looking for the cliched mexican restaurant with the mariachis and frozen cocktailsmargaritas then this place is for youpersonally i prefer contemporary mexican cuisine with good premium margaritas not that jose cuervosauza stuffunfortunately the food and service at casa de mateo were unremarkable as was the margarita  i dont know if we have much choice locally would love to hear any suggestions but i still think you need to head down south below the 49th parallel to find really good margaritas and mexican food
dXlpsSdtmZD9GYcgwoHC3w 1 bleh  uninspired  went to dine at mechant boeuf yesterday during the happening gourmand  chose the goat cheese appy mechant burger and chocolate mousse for dessert  nothing particularly good or bad  i would rate the food comparable to typical bar food  the bar is clearly the draw here  might return for beverages but not to dine again
Cgt3a27ECIw8xA34IcF5nw 3 the faubourg has seen better days but the bagel place continues to be one of my favorites  my favorite are the smoked salmon bagels  large serving of smoked salmon and cream cheese on top of a delicious bagel   cant beat that
3aU1Pr205Und16qh1AlXdw 1 i dont know what the last reviewer is talking aboutim asian and lived in vancouver most of my life so i would like to think i know a little about authentic asian cuisine and this place is certainly not thatgeneral tao and authentic dont belong in the same sentence together  pcame here for lunch and tried the pad thai not chinese and some fried beef dish  food was edible service thorough but menu caters to a western crowd
fIjEOZM4lTjqomJ1zUk4bQ 3 decent prices if you wait for a special buy in bulk  or print out the online coupons
qmtwPg7JXcBg1qW1PqYHSQ 1 ate here last week during the happening gourmandthe food came out very quickly  maybe too quickly you know what i meanits a funny thing when it comes to quick service  theres a fine line between an efficient waiter and feeling like theyre trying to rush you out the door and get their tipunfortunately it felt like the latterthe meal was affordable and decent however nothing outstanding
fk3ot9c2aPv9cazuzlxKpg 1 i paid 48 for a gel manicure as well as a 14 tip for my technician simone unfortunately my manicure fell apart within the first couple hours of getting it done i decided to add gems but they fell off my nails same day now my nails look tacky i called back to ask if they can redo it i was able to rebook with another technician i also asked if it would cost anything but the girl over the phone didnt know if id have to pay since it was a different technician also i can see through some on the polish clearly my gel manicure was not done properly i decided to call back to cancel the reschedule appointment being that i do not have the time and i dont want to pay for a mistake that is not mine  im very disappointed your service is not even close to being worth 48
ZMYFKlEGVO_H1wwM_REd3w 5 ive eaten gyros pretty much everywhere in az and this place is up there for one of the best
gRNqaG-rUXs9PvGIAJvrLQ 3 i stayed here after seeing rooms for 600 on expedia i really was thinking the worst i have to say i cant wait to go back the rooms are small but they are perfect for one or two people the air condition works great yes you need that in vegas all the staff was always nice  the valet people were always very friendly too my room had a good bath tub old school only complaint and its not a complaint the water in the shower must come from a volcano dam its hot guess to wash off the germs from the night late at night there was some working girls out on fremont street if thats what your looking for must have been the tuesday night special because there were tons of them overall i will be back good experience at the golden gate try the dolly parton slots they are fun
IlPJ37B04TDn5ckZmqSyGA 3 just being honest i think this place is overrated mac donalds fish sandwich or it reminded me of mrs pauls frozen fish was not earth shattering would i eat here again maybe i wouldnt go out of my way lived in phoenix 3 years and always saw it but first time trying it

1MNSRPRvglv4GXUGZwjURw 3 i ate here after reading the reviews on yelp it was just ok i got the big jim what aburger has gravy and biscuits thats just as good  looked like a bunch of goth skater cooks trying to serve some home style food my friend ate with me and he wasnt very impressed either i had a qt cup because qt ice tea is bomb and one of the skater workers said because of the liqueur license i had to throw it away it was ok i went i probably wouldnt go back
ipsSLb3F6sAsZZvSdcddBA 5 best meal ive had in a long time we started with the dim sum platter which was just incredible especially the duck dumpling we then had the spicy prawn black truffle duck and asian greens with ginger the flavour in each dish was just amazing the banana peanut dessert was the perfect ending to the delicious meal the hakka cocktail is not to be missed
Gt0lL_LUDX28SNw41jm3bw 3 ate here based on a suggestion waitress was friendly but when asked what she recommends she spoke really quickly and we didnt understand any of what she recommended food was very yummy but very small servings  i guess thats tapas for you cucumber mist cocktail was great fantastic view best to request a window seat or even a table on the patio sat by the window and we werent disappointed
HMy2pxGibZLt8uy1HmhOyw 1 posted some photos from the experience my wife and i had yesterday at paramount  heartland location you be the judge we were there at 5pm it wasnt busy at all the food served to us wasnt fresh i am so disappointed and i felt cheated when i saw the condition of the food which was served to us i am not a difficult customer and i dont create a scene either but since yesterday i cant forget the worst experience i have had and the upset stomach there were pieces of chicken skin fat in my shawarma platter and the salad was stale the fattoush salad we order didnt have the crispy chunks of fried pita it comes with small portions with lots of stale fries  is this what you call fine foods the service was extremely slow we had to look for someone to give us more pita bread the restaurant wasnt busy at all we clearly mentioned our table number to the server and she ended up serving the bread at another table i spent most of time time scavenge through our order and left with plates full of old food which seemed microwaved 45 for two platters and fattoush salad
7TD8uKS9QCviDGRKu_JnNQ 5 great moroccan  tunisian food served in small tapas like portions or as full meal  great setting for a drink  coffee see my earlier description

wu_YhmB6SURbwXuMgbkQwA 5 my boyfriend first started coming here when he injured himself during a workout and has been coming for months he absolutely loves dr reed reed has truly helped his back and hes far better than from before he used to sleep on a tennis ball due to discomfort he then referred my roommate who works an office job the slouching and being hunched over quite often has taken a toll on him so he came in and loved reed as well he had gone to a different chiro prior and made the switch i caved and stopped in myself i am a server and carry heavy items and trays so my lower and mid back are always aching im still just 20 but ever since coming here ive felt a huge difference in my whole body im definitely happy with where these sessions are going im aware of my posture at all times and that has helped me breathe better and digest better reed is very attentive to how your body works and since hes suggested better sleeping positions for me my nights have gotten significantly better grace up front is a gem i cant forget about shes very sweet and kind always picking up on conversations and just brightens up my afternoons everyone is great so even if you stop in just to check it out or ask questions totally worth it

Tts1xFazswk5eTlA1vjYDQ 5 despite being 22 ive got quite a long history with dentists i grew up without proper dental visits resulting in 4 decayed molars at 18 i took myself to one of those chain dental offices and paid over 1500 for two root canals i was never given an explanation as to what a root canal was or that id need to pay for crowns separately so i got the roots taken care of but due to insufficient funds because im 18 i couldnt afford crowns to keep them secure from 1921 i hopped from local dentists to dental schools and even mexico to save money on the treatments crowns bone grafts i couldnt pull through with most places because they were discomforting and too businesslike finally i found this place on yelp and after the consultation with dr walker i knew i could trust his work he thoroughly went over my teeth proposed a treatment plan and even broke it down into separate operations to help lessen the financial stress most dental places feel fancy and the work they suggest never seems necessary like they just want my money but here i understood the importance of each extraction and surgery because dr walker took the time to explain things in the past few months we extracted a tooth did a bone graft and a root canal retreatment all were extremely terrifying at first but i trusted him everything went smoothly and even when the retreatment got complicated dr walker comforted me by staying positive and updating me throughout the procedure the scariest thing is hearing someone say oh no without a followup to be honest i was trying to stay awake so i could keep my mouth open it was that easygoing in the room i genuinely appreciate the work hes done and cant say enough about how great my endo experience was the receptionists and assistants are always a pleasure as well its pretty familyoriented in there so they tend to remember you

CyYv--_6Wvak6infKMl-oQ 5 delicious food that is prepared quickly we were visiting charlotte from the dc area and needed something fast before heading to the airport to catch our flight right after we ordered i filled up my cup with some freshly brewed ice tea sweet and unsweet and by the time i walked outside to claim a table the food was ready fortunately they dont have that gold peak  aka gold piss crap that a lot of restaurants have in maryland i love brewed tea so we ate outside at one of the tables there are only about 34 tables out front so most people just grab their food and go overall a great place for gyros that is affordable and ready in a snap i suspect other items on the menu are also tasty but i can only comment on what i ate and it was delicious

RIP6HA9pQ-yhJgbgDMzDfw 5 i cant recommend haulin goats enough  the day before the goats came out heather stopped by and we showed her the area we want the goats to weed  it was very easy and took very little time  the next day the goats came over and went to work  the area the goats were weeding for us was overgrown with poison ivy making it impossible for us to get in and weed ourselves  the goats absolutely tore through the poison ivy  in fact the poison ivy seemed to be there favorite because they ate it first  because it was a big area that was very overgrown it took a 23 days but the goats absolutely cleared everything out  the goats cant clear everything out like weed killer but the most they left were a few small weeds sticking a few inches out of the ground  we were very surprised how well it worked  also the area where the goats were focused was along the bank of a lake and we werent sure how the goats would do because a lot of the poison ivy was very close to the water  but the goats took care of everything  we were blown away with how well the goats worked out  if youre looking for a nonchemical method to get rid of poison ivyweeds i cant recommend haulin goats enough  the process was easy and pain free and the kids in the neighborhood loved coming over to see the goats

c0EgsPRrXPlVmfc4fTGAfQ 5 another extremely good gun shop i have been here several times when i am in the phoenix area these folks really have their sht together especially since i hail from the peoples republic of california they are very willing to work with you so that you can legally get a fire arm back to the motherland  they also have a huge and very reasonably priced inventory to boot time spent here usually is very well spent major kudos to all hands involved

7Nydn1NwZ8Gxab9VasDcjw 3 just stayed at this lovely hotel  the reason for 4stars is that they need to tell you it is back off the strip and a hike to get to any of the other hotels beside the bellagio hotel it was bad jus getting around and trying to navigate a way out of there period now to the good part  the rooms are spectacular because there all suites  with a door bell   beautiful view of the strip and water show  if your so lucky to get panoramic view we were lucky  good service friendly staff  if you want to relax and not have the hustle and bustle of the strip it is recommended  also remember to bring up the groceries for the full kitchen 
Wt1wNaBwXa20kV6Hrf5KVw 1 i went to shake shack the other night as it was on my list of places to try in vegas  easy access this time because i stayed at the mgm hotel not impressed at all actually disappointed in the place  pricey and lacking burger  after ordering the double bacon burger and milk shake  mouth was waiting for explosion  total flop after opening up the bag to see this small ass burger needless to say this place was a dud to me imo  oh yea the shake was also a bust for me  never to return  glad there was no line when i went
R1Ij3P8oGhAPNKjP4N9cRA 3 hit up the monte carlo to treat my mom and wife for there 1st time here they were dressed in the all white of course  ive been to the other bar at mandalay bay so this is the same layout for me  kind of small and quaint inside  my mom and wife really enjoyed  themselves and we stayed in ther for 30 min having 2 drinks and some good conversation about this experience  nice bonding  something unique and different thats for sure a  good time out  kind of pricey but well worth it for 1st timers 
Mael5lR7i0aB2in4SZe5Aw 1 bad customer service i waited in lobby for 25 minutes and no one even came out to help me
1VD6N64hVkMyzyKfAZXmwA 5 this place has the best falafels we have dinner here probably once a week and the food and service is always top notch everything we have tried on their menu is always good the chicken special sand which is also another favorite and must try
wM229qQisw3nJu-UO_zjmQ 1 i was really excited to visit this place because of its funky look and ddd but it was a total let down we went on a sunday afternoon and it just us and like a couple of other tables so they were not busy at all and the service was so incredibly slow and bad our appetizer and the kids meal we ordered came out pretty fast but then we literally waited for like 30 minutes for our food which we learned later was just sitting under the heat lamps for like 15 minutes there were like 3 servers hanging around not busy while our food just sat there and our server was hanging out at a table sitting with them for like 10 minutes when our food was just sitting there finally we got up and asked where our food was and it still took another 5 or so minutes for someone to bring it the tacos were soggy by this time and not good aside from the bad service the food was just a total let down the kids meal was gross and our tacos were soggy and it seems the oil was old because everything fried had a bad taste to it this was a bummer because this was a place we were excited to visit and we left not even enjoying or completing our meal
mxbYkPLTSzyHwobxAo7Xfw 1 this place is so dirty and really bad customer service and the worst thing is that on my last visit there and it will definitely be my last the employee had a  cat in the back of the kitchen running around which is so incredibly unsanitary especially around the food
p3P7EtPFexolKYonxvC41A 1 me and a group of friends went to this place one night when they had live music we had a very bad experiance and ended up leaving because of the rude service we were a small group and we are obviously different looking than the crowd in the restaurant the servers at the bar where very rude and no one offered to take our order or seat us then there was an open booth near the front and we asked to sit at that table and one of the servers told us that it was taken even though no one was sitting there like 10 minutes later a white couple came in and they offered the booth to them we finally realized that there was a back room with empty tables and we went and seated ourselves and literally waited for 15 minutes before anyone even walked over to our table to ask for our drinks they saw us seat ourselves which is why we finally got the hint that we were not welcome and got up and left i think unless your a local in the neighborhood i would not visit this place very rude and unwelcoming atmosphere
0_MLaqWz9uDrrLEcr65TxA 1 this place has a serious problem with unwelcoming and rude servers we have been back a few times because the food is pretty good but each time the servers are always rude and not friendly at all and the service is slow because they hangout in the back behind counter and talk
KhQsGSlQKXjI58zLqqLwVg 5 i met ms roxana valeton at the rio hotel convention  center during the community wellness and resource  fair she was so sweet  friendly  and accommodating she told me about a new day community  center and since i was new in town and looking for a doctor i called for an appointment the clinic had a friendly  atmosphere  i found the staff extremely helpful and courteous  my doctor dr mostafa sheta was very knowledgeable and professional to top it all they gave me samples of some of my medications i have nothing but praises for this health center go check it out
DkB1U132ZDPnjN1EbknROg 5 shes located 2 seconds from my house inside of the sports cuts salon i somehow managed to bypass for 10 years today was my first time ever coming to shabi and it really felt like the thousandth right away she was so sweet and and treated me like a personal friend i have no idea how but she managed to work with what little brows i had and made them look amazing she is so precise and really knows what shes doing i read all her reviews on yelp before deciding to go here and im so glad i did im going to recommend her to everyone
NmHSnV4pDK3oX768T1bxhw 1 i gave this hotel 2 stars because i did not see any mice roaches or bed bugs in my roomthe key to staying at this hotel is have your paperwork in order if you dont they will double charge youthats just the way it is i booked this hotel through priceline made sure not to give my credit card to the hoteldo not give these people your credit card i wanted an early checkin but they wanted to charge me an additional 1495 resort fee for checking in before 11am the resort fee is an additional 1495 per night i waited until 11am to check inthe resort fee is for internet service in your room supposedlyi believe its just a way for the hotel to make more moneywhen i did check in the woman at the front desk tried to charge me for 5 night resort fee when i only paid for 4 nights through price line i had to correct her by showing her my price line paperworki used cash for 100 refundable incidental deposit and the 3 night resort fee which was slightly under 60they tried to put me in a handicapped room dont know why but i requested a regular room insteadduring check in if you dont correct these people early they will double charge you or give you a terrible room i still ended up with a really bad roomthe room i had was in the basement the window view was an outside wall the bathtub was clogged with hair an green slimy stuff i tried to pour bleach in it to unclog it but that did not work the bathroom sink had hair in it the carpet looked old dingy and dirtythe entire room reeked of cigarette smokethe buffet was badfor some reason it looked like the food had been sitting out all day without being stirred or freshened up or replace and it was not cheap  dinner cost 12 i didnt complain to management about my experience at the hotel i didnt think they would do anything about itaccording to the other reviews i readits a cheap ran down smelly hotelat least i wasnt double charged its not the maid fault that the rooms are ran down
geLzz_pahSmm_7CznvqlBw 3 the food there is really good service was not that great but not terrible either they have 1000000 tvs for watching sports  the place itself is really big great for big crowds
nbXpWZWTOog4Zuumb1DJtQ 5 food is so good they have a new menu out with new pasta dishes and pizzas service is great they deliver also their food is like having a restaurant like olive garden deliver to you the average delivery time for them is about 35 minutes pick up is 12 minutes

jnSDGSArqQYJ1vHLIExkyw 3 i go there probably 2 or 3  a week for the last year and nothings really changed monday night is the best night to go beer is 2 dollars and mixed drinks are 250 other than monday they are very expensive for the location and the service you receive they have 1 or 2 great bartenders and the rest are either drunk on the job or too busy caring on conversations with their friends to get you a beer they do have a great setup for watching sports and a lot of space food is pretty decent too and fairly priced to be a mom and pops bar its pretty decent on monday night thats the night to go good crowd too
vUqHvbp-Q6ICUdwfoMSlSg 1 if i could leave stars blank i would this place was gross dont get me wrong great server n food was good for bar food but after finding a fruit fly in a beer i was grossed out i asked for the beer to be removed from my tab the manager would not allow it she made us pay for it i dont complain much as my perffesion is a general manager in the food industry we even killed two more at our table before she came to speak to us her excuse was that its the end of summer and this happens today is december 5th in ohio  never been so offended in intellegence and sheer customer service will never go back they gave me a cup of bugs and told me to deal with it wow
o9kd-SAqumPrsudYFBxvsA 3 this place is great all beer and mixed drinks are only 2 dollars inside the place is huge and every friday and saturday they are packed they play good music and the servers are really fast only problem i have and i warn you be careful if you pay with your credit card they make mistakes sometimes and overcharge the other night my tab was 18 dollars but the next day when i check my bank account there were 2 charges from them other than that great place to hang out friendly people

XoEGsMpiTmqRk7G0mQpb-g 1 me and my 5 year old son stopped at this place for lunch first time we have ever been there i walk in immediately start looking at the menu on the wall young lady asked me what i liked was very helpful i brought two corn beef sandwiches i noticed that they had chairs where you can sit down so me and my son sat down and waited on our food when we received the food i figured hey lets just stay here and eat i started to pull my food out to give my son his sandwich and a rude nigerian or jamaican guy so not politely told me how theres a sign by the door stating if its pick up you must leave then after embarrassing me in front of the entire restaurant he proceeded to yell out to a crew member put a bigger sign up  im pretty shocked at the way the customer service in this restaurant most restaurants would have let something as simple as me deciding to change my mind from pick up to dine in go especially when i spent about 20 on two sandwiches pretty sure i wont ever go back there again besides they gave me a cold cornbeef sandwich the swiss cheese was not even melted and the worst part about it all they dont put mustard on the sandwich it could have been handled better at least offer me the option to pay the dollar to dine instead of just throwing me out
ItgnZXFHPxWJICFoLZtIog 3 i think this place is great all around i like the location in north olmsted better because its bigger and theres a more attentive larger staff as well but who can argue with 2 dollar drinks and decent service beer cheese soup amazing
YuaNzxaC2wrxWn7WOKnePA 3 very fast service but the place is so nice youll feel like 1 burger will cost you 20 dollars but its only mcdonalds
5QNdDqYtpySykhZyrlkGsQ 3 this place is pretty cool good service a little pricey but not that bad great outdoor patio set up for the summer worth going to and they have daily specials
nkPCFLK0aUkMhbL96kBsYQ 1 his show in paris casino isnt worth its high price  i paid for it and was disappointed from the moment that i walked into the venue which was about the size of a large conference  its a cheap production and should have been priced in line with other hynotist shows  go see the video next the venue to see the shows highlights but dont expect more from his show  you can expect boobs on video raunchy expletives and simulated sex
_28NJR0zf06sKIBvaa_NfA 5 i was here before an event at the arena and had a blast  the beer cheese dip was the best i have had in years  the staff was fast and efficient  i will stop here again the next time i am in town  overall the section was outstanding  prices were low
eaoLDo2Jc1SNLqO4ltEoPA 3 like a few reviewers before im somewhat conflicted on how i feel about this place its a great addition to those who live in the sw side of town and they do have tasty pastries i guess im biased because i had really high expectations on coming here from all the reviews and its been in my bookmarks for some time now its clean and good compared to other asian pastry shops here in town but if you ever travel outside of vegas youll see that there are places that can execute the balance of flavors a little better if i could give it 35 i would we tried the coffee jelly tiramisu and green tea cream puff theyre all fine but i didnt finish any of them which is unusual for me even though im only giving it 3 stars for now i do encourage you to give it a try to taste something different here in vegas
ez6k7MoxHz2pixT_hkBUrQ 3 quality of the sushi and food is good  didnt care much for the rice  it was a little hard  the server was nice but the place got really busy and i felt like we waited around an awful lot  then later on the place smelled like something was burning not sure if id come back again for lunch because if you have plans after  you wont make your schedule maybe ok for dinner
NiNi02Qr2zteMROtupFVYg 3 its funny another yelper mentioned a great ambiance  but i guess its not to my taste i dont need silence when eating my ramen but the music was way too loud its not really enjoyable when you server has to yell at you and you have to yell back for them to hear you to make matters worse there was awkwardness at the communal table between the random couples yes ive sat at communal tables before without issue thank goodness the food was better than i expected if it was just based on food id have given it 445 stars
NSddNtCMcYmDVgLa5Ah1qQ 5 we enjoyed an incredible dinner here tonight  having dined at michelin star rated chefs restaurants in tokyo japan i can assure you  this is the real deal  you get to enjoy an artfully presented well balanced tasting menu that leaves you full but not stuffed  truly a great experience and one not to be missed 
fBpCN3nyuo5tTfsbNtoyBw 5 enjoyable happy hour menu  it was a great way to try everything we will be back again and are getting the truffle edamame and black cod lettuce wrap again for sure so i made the cardinal mistake of posting before i finished my meal with dessert  the green tea tiramisu was amazing  im a big fan of the milk tea ice cream too also i was really impressed by how knowledgable our server was about the menu she described everything perfectly and you always have to appreciate it when the chef takes the time to come out of the kitchen to touch greet every table
1ZcmZ2Ln-0z2I4Hd2Gw77g 3 dined there last night with friends and while the food would definitely merit a 5 out of 5 stars the service was probably one of the worst ive had i understand they were very busy and had a lot of things going on large party in the other room large parties in the main room  but theres a way to be busy and gracious without so muchtension it was outright awkward one person in the party didnt get their food then another guest was accused of taking that dish  but i guess the server didnt punch in the order correctly for the ticket it was just weird and uncomfortable another guest asked for help in getting drinks ordered and no one would respond id have typically given it 1 star but hopefully i came here on an atypical night and would like to give them the benefit of the doubtor maybe suggest takeout to fellow yelpers 
qhLs2cOFyLYT_m2PKPxKJg 5 what a surprise came here from a recommendation by a friend and it lived up to its rep its got a nice trendy modern sort of atmosphere and combined with tasty thai fusion i dont know if id call it 100 traditional  its a definite hit  well be back again
Okb9rOyRonnT1KVGs6gCww 5 after asking a friend of mine of where to go  i took my suv down to island auto for an oil change and a check engine light that was on in my car  the owner was really nice and honest  he didnt give me the runaround or try to overcharge me  my car was repaired well and for a much better price than what the dealership wanted to charge me  will be back again
nuEuQ7Rw4QqZ8FBVaMq47w 5 i have to be honest  i feel for the girls who had a poor experience at this davids bridalbut i personally had the complete opposite experience  i walked in one day on the spur of the moment with my fianc and made an appointment for later in the week when he wouldnt be there  when i arrived with my mom that morning i was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk  she got basic info from me on what i was looking forbudgetetc  we then were led to the fitting area with my consultant tatiana  after reviewing what i was looking for she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on  she took the time to ask me what i liked and didnt like from each of my dresses  she was really sweet professional and genuine  i told myself i wasnt going to buy a dress at my first appointment everbut after 3 hours of trying on dresses and trying my favorites back on a second timei selected the gown of my dreams  not only was i never rushed or ever made to feel like i was just a sale my consultant tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day  she didnt try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget  she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful  i ended up picking a dress that wasnt even what i had in mind  and im so glad for it  the manager was also very polite and my mom and i were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us  yes the store had other brides and yes there were others looking in the mirrors and yes my consultant had to split her timebut its such an exciting moment  i didnt realize how much time was passing and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress  as someone who also works in guest service i can tell you tatiana was great at multitasking  she gave me all the time i needed and when she was working with me she had her focus completely on me  when i came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash i had another great experience  the lady at the desk this time also greeted me and helped me find the headpieces since i now wanted to try them on too  a consultant who was in the area was really kind and he asked me if i needed help and offered suggestions for what i was looking for  when i finally made my way to the counter an pick up what i was actually there to get my order the manager and consultant there were both greati am honestly blown away with it all because i know its rare to find that level of incredible service from a large chain  thank you tatiana and the whole crew at this davids bridal location  ill be sure to come back and get all my bridesmaid dresses  accessories very soon  
t31CKdnpC_tGUI2BrDo_XQ 5 my husband and i went there last night once we landed in las vegas and i am happy we did the slices are huge and delicious i did however just get the basic cheese pizza kind of hard to screw up but i have no complaintsi will definitely be going back for another slice before i go home
M22Nx6kzmqL_dMWD-FAwEA 5 i went here for lunch today and it was great i first walked by the place yesterday and couldnt stop thinking how good it probably is and turns out i was correct  i got a strawberry margarita guacamole  and beef burrito  the drink was strong  guac was fresh and the shredded beef burrito was so flavourful and filling i was only able to eat about half of it the service was awesome it was happy hour and our waiter was very attentive with our drinks and the food was out within 15 mins i would recommend this place to any mexican food lovers mmmm
orJUJJMes6ehBzfJA0fttw 1 not only was my vehicle towed for no explicable reason but attaining it was an extremely frustrating situation their website states that they are open daily from 8 am to 630 pm upon calling them the rude woman on the telephone told me that they had indeed closed at 12 pm that day but for an extra 40 fee they could have a driver come release my vehicle to me in no less than 45 mins lets just say ive been waiting for over 2 hours have called them several times and have still not gotten my vehicle im extremely dissatisfied with their poor customer service and value for the time of others
3_CJFwV7QyHuyGW10bPg9A 3 when we first arrived here i thought this place would be a 5 star experience their bacon board and apple pie moonshine is out of this worldafter we had the bacon board my husband and i took our servers suggestion and ordered their short ribs which our server said were phenomenal the short ribs come with fried coleslaw and we asked the server if we could sub asparagus and not get the fried coleslaw so the short ribs and asparagus come out the short ribs were tough small and didnt have much flavorthen when our bill came we were charged the full amount of the short ribs and coleslaw and an additional 4 for our asparagus which clearly shows that its 4 on its own so why did we have to pay full price to sub them and then not get a side that was supposed to come with our meal so we basically paid full price to not receive a side and paid an extra four dollars for asparagus that would have been 4 regardless if it was subbed or not we also experienced some issues splitting our bill and my husband and i were charged 30 more than we were supposed to be even after telling our server that some of the items on our receipt werent ours before she swiped our card we were still overcharged and had to cancel one tab but still be recharged for the otherthis place started out a wonderful experience but it seemed to get worse and worse as the night when oni will definitely go back but only for the bacon board and moonshine not the entrees
17MmKs-QW6-mbQcmQX84uA 1 big 2 toyota is one of the worst auto dealers in arizona if you want a new car save yourself time and money by going to power toyota in tempe a year ago my boyfriend and i bought a brand new four runner from big 2 they seemed nice when we were there but our payments were outrageous a year later we decided we needed to trade our vehicle in because the payments were so high we went to power and they asked for our contract we gave them all our paperwork big 2 had given us and came to find out they never gave us a copy of the contract they also told us our payments were so high because almost 8000 of stuff was added on to our contract that we didnt need they even added a life insurance policy for over 3000guess whati was 21 at that time and my bf was 24 we had no idea that we had agreed to all that stuff and felt so stupid that we let them take advantage of us power toyota pulled some major strings to help us because we had so much negative equity now big 2 owes us a lot of money in cancellation refunds and when i called to find out the status of our refund they said theyd call me back and never did i even left a voicemail for the finance director brian and never heard from him my boyfriend went through the same thing today after pulling some strings we finally got them to call us back and we find out they lost our paperwork horrible business full of deceitful uncaring unprofessional people toyota is a wonderful company and big 2 completely hurts their image once i get my refund i will never do business with them again and tell all my friends and family to avoid them and go to power where they are not looked at as a number but as a person

st4AW8yb3Hh6QTrxpky1UA 5 my husband and i got married on the terrace at vegas weddings on 82915 and let me just tell you that it was one of the best experiences of our lives from the planning of the ceremony to the initial consultation at the venue to the actual ceremony to the photo viewing appointment after the ceremonywe were very very happy with everything  yvette prather was our wedding coordinator and the first person we had contacted about booking our wedding there she was very helpful with getting all of my questions answered and addressing all of the concerns that i had our package included a luxury sedan picking us up from our hotel and taking us to get our marriage license and then to the initial consultation at the venue the driver of the luxury sedan was awesome and super sweetshe even gave us a card to congratulate us on the wedding very thoughtful once we got to the venue to see it for the first time and have the consultation we worked with danielle she was amazing she was very friendly and answered all of the questions that we had we were also very happy with the terrace i could see where it would be a little small for people who have a lot of guests for our wedding it was just my husband and i and the venue could not be more perfect we had another luxury sedan driver that dropped us off for brunch after the consultation and he was awesome too our package also included a limo driver to take us to and from the ceremony and that limo driver was amazing and very nice and friendly as well a few minutes after we arrived for our ceremony they brought us upstairs to wait in the bridal suite we probably stayed in there for 30 minutes or so before our ceremony started it was so nice that we got to stay in there before the ceremony because they do have other weddings going on at the same time and it made us feel special and like it was just our day while we were waiting in the bridal suite we met reverend garcia who was very nice and sweet and just all around awesome we also had several pictures taken in the bridal suite and our photographer was amazing and did a wonderful job our ceremony went off without a hitch we chose 2 songs to play when i walked down the aisle and then when we walked out and that made it very sentimental and special we were also each able to recite our own vows which made it even more personal i had chosen to have the rose petals sprinkled down the aisle as well and was very happy with that decision as it turned out looking great all in all the venue was spectacular we had a 930 pm ceremony and it just turned out so lovely at that time because the gazebo is lit up and looks beautiful we were very very pleased with the venue we had some friends and family members who watched the online live streaming of our ceremony back home and they said that it turned out great and they felt like they were able to join in on our special day after the ceremony we had more pictures taken which pretty much all turned out awesome by the way and then we checked out by giving them the address to mail our marriage certificate to after the ceremony our limo driver dropped us off at top of the world restaurant at the stratosphere and he was just as kind as could be we had our photo viewing appointment back at vegas weddings the morning after our ceremony at that appointment less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended we were able to view a wedding slideshow of pictures that they had edited we absolutely fell in love with the majority of the pictures that they had taken and ended up just purchasing our entire photo package at that time the entire package is kind of pricy but it is only a fraction of what we would have paid a photographer back home if we had had a traditional ceremony they were able to give us a cd copy of our wedding slideshow a dvd copy of our wedding video and a cd copy of all of our wedding pictures in color sepia black and white and thumbnail versions in hand at the end of that appointmentwhich means that we received all of that less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended and the pictures were high quality and turned out so beautiful i was floored especially when i hear of so many people complaining that they have not received their wedding photos a month or more after their wedding i was very blown away that they had everything done and ready to go that quickly it was awesome and the quality of our wedding video was amazing tooit turned out so well everyone that we worked with through vegas weddings was very friendly helpful and dedicated to making our wedding experience there as special for us as possible we would recommend for anyone considering getting married in vegas to get married at vegas weddings i will even be telling people who are engaged and not sure of what they want their wedding to be like yet to go to vegas just to get married at vegas weddings it is an awesome place

XXhvCGetTf1X1Awk7pEgKw 1 ill spare you the long winded version this restaurant is another product of a bad trend happening in toronto a mediocre restaurant that somehow gets great reviews from pretentious rags such as toronto life globe and mail etc and the virulent contagion spreads to the minds of every subsequent reviewer and patron of said trendy localethe food at this restaurant is just ok it deserves no better than 25 stars my partner and i eat out a lot and this might be the most overhyped restaurant weve tried in the past 24 months avoid
zlgE71VNTfWOEMmPjN6KmQ 5 this place is sooooo good the service has always been very good and the food is always on point the guac station they have going on is where its at everything is always fresh and the servers are always friendly highly recommend this place
ME2tAIjppbzathM_FamU4g 3 ive been to this firehouse a few times recently and have been pretty pleased the first few times the service has been a bit slow and lacking personality however i took my wife with me this last visit and there was a bar tender with a broken foot who had us almost in tears from laughing so hard there were a few older gentlemen a few seats down from us and she was joking with them and chatting about their family and her kids this bar now seems to be more of a local place to hang out with good company rather than a typical sports bar that you just go to from time to time  if there were a better selection of craft beers the firehouse would have 5 stars easily  not even a decent ipa the bartender was knowledgeable about beer however the bar had nothing good to offer  we were  also introduced to the eli steak which was delicious it is not on the menu which makes no sense to us but we will be back for it

-mce34K7T-0kof2qAXF9-g 1 bought a chair for 400 for my home office from this location as a gift to myself after a promotion  i only spend about 1 day a week in the home office  in 15 years the synthetic leather in the chair totally fell apart  conveniently the warranty was only 1 year  structube personnel at this location and the head office refused to do anything even after repeated attempts at contacting them  i wouldve expected a 400 chair to last at least ten years when used only once a week  my previous 80 staples chair lasted more than 8 yearsstructube poor quality expensive furniture  although it is good looking  just dont expect it to last

9lvYgAzdnWEBqml6aNnpoA 5 my most favourite italian restuarant in the vaughan area  and this area is full of italian restaurant  this is definitely not a typical italian though  they have eastern twists in various dishes  which make it different in a great way  the dishes are simply more flavourful  i love the various pasta sauces and seasoning that use saffron  the chicken pastas steak pastas and seafood pastas are all awesome  i am not a big steak person and have also heard that their steaks are not their strong point  the two poutines are really great as well  which again also are different from regular poutines as they have hints of eastern flavours  awesome restaurant  if you feel like having italian and want to try something different this is definitely the place
0LCVtgVHLhMamZABpmeFsg 5 bamiyan kebab has the best kebab options period  their various chicken and beef kebabs are all amazing  its really good to go with a bunch of people that you can try all the kebabs  been to all their locations and the meat is always fresh and tasty and consistently good  their quality and freshness is definitely higher than some of the other kebab options in the area  highly recommended  its also great for people who are new to different ethnic foods as this is relatively mild and you can add as much spice as you want on the side as needed

HKCjiie2QIgWD2BjfCb4Zw 5 my favourite pakistaniindian restaurant in gta  its worth the drive to mississauga even if you are in ajax to come to this place  they have the best bihari kabab peshawari kabab karahi dishes and over all dishes ive tried which is almost all of them are super delicious and mouth watering  its a little small so its always a good idea to call and make sure they are not busy before going  as its quite popular and there is often a wait especially on weekends  that alone tells you that this is a great place

oL7WX8mzJu1_-vyXgVlAKQ 5 have been using for the past few months instead of a company i had been using for 20 years because the old supplier just sells ice and did not return phone calls  great customer service  you need ice right away they try to handle right away  have storage box issues they have immediate response and usually an immediate solution  nice owners and accomodating pleasant delivery staff  the ice is good too
C778Du7g0I-lL4QmZapW2A 1 i unfortunately had similar a similar experience dealing with leah that many of the other reviewers had she came across wonderfully in my initial meeting with her but things quickly went downhill she showed up at my wedding with a friend that she claimed was her second photographer but i dont think that friend took any pictures my bridesmaids later told me that leah was saying she didnt even want to be therei paid her plenty of money to be there i had to beg her for pictures after a few months and then got about 100 less than what was promised in the contract oh and no reception pictures i dont have a single picture of me dancing with my husband or father i asked her about this and she came up with excuse after excuse finally after 8 months and the threat of a lawsuit she admitted she didnt have any pictures from the reception leah has changed her company name so many times im sure due the bad reviews and it makes me so mad that shes still out there duping people please do not do business with her

SMbAV2io0tGBGisi81L6dg 3 this is by far one of my favorite places to eat in charlotte based off of a couple of things 1 the menu is very vast almost too vast at points though so you are bound to find something that suits your fancy 2 the atmosphere is great  crowded but not too crowded cool artwork on the walls awesome bar with a giant salt water fish tank that spans the front wall great outdoor seating by the fountain if that suits your fancy 3 the food is yum the bento box is my favorite as you get a little of everything burger and sushi 4 love that when you enter the bathroom the background music is 3 voice where one is a sentence in english one in redneck and one in japanese  5 the service has always been top notch 6 they have a combination burger and sushi option that is called burgushinovel ideal biggest draw back to me is that there is always a wait and reservations are hard to come by unless you make then well in advance also not a fan of no drink specials on the weekend  overall a fun place that i will continue to support
YXqza-whN942cjc28Hu7Aw 5 great foodone of the best burgers in charlotte spuds are good and a very generous portion will be back
kDlrKCscvZDCKclDpbnX4w 5 based on the reviews i called prima sweet shop from the first conversation she was very attentive and had good customer service she gives great attention to detail to make sure you are satisfied with your order the cake pops were prettier than i had imagined and they were absolutely delicious the flavors that were ordered were vanilla chocolate and red velvet everyone at the party were awed at how beautiful they were and enjoyed them even more when they ate them the prices were very reasonable especially given the exceptional service and quality of the cake pops
h110SyoiTAptnBf_02y7-w 1 the guy in purple shirt  asking the black bus boy to go out back and fight what a turn off from this place 3rd time i ate here from out town this loud mouth pushing what  seems  to be a manager  never again will i eat there cause of him and i staying across the  street for 2 months  for work shame  on him the girls were just shaking  there head cause of his behavior  lots of kids with  family present
ffGsRht3FK7yzsgMTMuw9w 3 food was greatbut they use msgso tell them no msg or you will wake up the next day with an msg headache
6OMzVvLMwMy_mBOJNnz0ow 3 if i was rating on food alone this would absolutely be 5 stars we split the tofu tod for an appetizer panko coated and fried tofu with a crazy good sweetspice dipping sauce the tofu was well seasoned its easy for fried things to go bland and this didnt and had great texture i had chicken pad thai for 13 it was a generous portion it came out piping hot and with a perfect level of spice i requested on the mild side of medium which isnt easy to naili also tried my husbands massaman curry with chicken sweet potato and peanut it was phenomenal really rich from coconut milk with great flavor and heat the service here wasnt bad but theyre definitely still learning our waitress mentioned that her brother opened the restaurant with his wife and im happy to support a family business while they sort out the kinks i think this is a great addition to the neighborhood and will routinely be slammed glad they offer take out
lmKiMucYvzlRorzTIJQw1g 1 food was cold and didnt taste good then to top it off the manager was yelling at these two ladies and just being so rude when they went nicely up to him to inform him that they werent satisfied with the food yeah after that im good id rather go to dennys

5qAJghT7TWdu10_t7qcIqA 1 absolutely awful experience if i could give no stars i would this used to be my favorite nail salon but since the new owners took over it has gone downhill the customer service is horrible and their services are shoddy at best it took a total of 7 minutes for my pedicure from start to finishi was cut twice on my cuticles no callus treatment and no massage apparently a pedicure now consists of soaking feet and painting nails only i will be on the hunt for a new salon never coming back to this one
p0U2xPzQgaxfSDcE4fRCmA 5 i want to thank impact boot camp for the helpsupport in my lifestyle changes  i first tried impact boot camp with a groupon special  i knew i needed a change from my regular boring work outs at the gym  it seemed like i was just going through the motions and not really seeing any success  i liked the trial so much i ended up joining as a member  there are 3 instructors all with their own unique style which makes it a nice change and fun to work out  the workouts are always different and challenging  the best part to me is all i have to do is show up and give it my all they have the workout all planned for me no thinking involved of what do i have to do next  after a few months of eating right and doing impact boot camp for about 4 days a week i have lost 105 lbs and almost 6 body fat  im very pleased with my results and look forward to continuing with impact boot camp for even more improvements
PWAAVV0dhGMAx1RGS76r0Q 1 i went to the cafebar at the pool they charged me 5 for 4 onion rings when i went to tell the front desk how disappointed i was they took no ownership and said that the cafe was owned by someone else  this cafe is ripping their members off in addition there was construction around the pool and it smelled like sewerage i am disappointed and wont stay here again let alone buy their time share

paBLyLebRO1jC_7H7FaTMA 5 so whenever you have a california gurl in a mexican restaurant it has to be good  my weary tummy has not had anything substantial all day and having read the best of the best about the amazing la tolteca i decided to let me feet hit the street  check out this local flor in the rough  well i have to say the reviews are all truth  the green enchiladas were my choice as ive not ever been huge fan of the red sauce in addition to a full range of all that one could feast your immediate appetite too there is also fresh tortillas candy the bakery which is a temptation i did avoid thank you p90x and yes i did say it the temptation is the bakery  the smells hit your nose before you even step in yeast sugar and spices la raza  enjoy your time dont rush i wandered around and grabbed my favorite fanta to connect the true flavors of home cali and my youth thanks for the great time la tolteca and youd better be sure that ill be stopping in again with reinforcements   gracias  happy eating
7dvoi6sJFQzsS8WlsC4DRQ 1 came for dinner and so unbelievably disappointed ordered salmon which was jerky not a filet management deemed it to be edible and did nothing to rectify the situation miserable experience and would never recommend this restaurant

tuqLUCL3165DZEWoQFX7ng 1 its not typical for my husband and i to try restaurants that have unusual name not recommended by someone we know nor because were not the adventurous kind unless its the only thing open and were dying of hunger maybe theres a slight chance and if it werent for the voucher we got this restaurant aint in our list to try when in vegas but it was a winwin good opportunity to try since its free dinner with exceptions of dessert alcohol tax and gratuitywe were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed our server named juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should i say was too busy  favoring the group before us it made it more noticeable after weve eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room but what the hell they all does the same but to be determined to bring quality service which i felt juan didnt deliver well i had brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh bucca di beppo or bravos all located in hawaii probably could have done a better version its pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels which the only thing i liked shrimp and salmon fish thats super untasty my husband had surf  turf rodizio with unlimited meat serving and my inlaws had grilled salmon and skirt steak not part of this review while my child had loaded cheese fries bacon cheese sour cream all ots because we have a picky eater going back to my husbands food that didnt impress me at all even if theres different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it due to lack of consistency they seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys not a big fan of dead carcass im a wannabe plant based dieter so i cant really attest how good it was for my husband but i can tell it didnt really pass to his liking the meat choices and service to end the night we had some confusion with our server juan i should have mentioned this beforehand and the server shouldve done the same with warning us with water charge per person like who does that i guess only pampas brazilian grille or the voucher couldve printed it too with other exceptions plus the way juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end he customized the receipt like theyre trying to manipulate something and call me stingy or whatever but i didnt like the force tipping impression thats why its called a tip because its up to the guest if they think it was welldeserved at that case he obviously didnt earn the whole 15 because i had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husbands and childs water just so i can go on with my dinner plus its not even ice cold they charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle there was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groupsgiving it two stars only because it was free dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner go get that voucher as a visa card instead
Jzy0jASWTA7XJlZiAWi4OA 5 excellent   the smoked salmon app was some of the best i have ever had very moist and cooked perfectly but with the right amount of smokey flavor i have the filet and crab cake special with red mashed potatoes   the filet was cooked perfect at med rare but the outside was seared to perfection   the crab cake was also done perfectly with huge lumps of crab meat and little filler lastly the mashed potatoes were thick and very flavorful you know your dinner was great when the mashed potatoes are the worst thing on the plate 
iHBhAvJsiVgpU1II0Hzvlg 3 moving to clt from pdx we were kinda excited to experience noda we heard about this place and followed it in ig finally made out way to the area and its def like a portland vibe only they food missed the mark  i got the fried chicken and waffles chicken was average and the waffle was bland and hard like a brick i absolutely hated the syrup hush puppies were the best thing we ordered and were prob the best ive had since moving here bacon jelly biscuit was also good but i wouldnt order it again overall its a fun spot with average food but we will go back  at some point to try it again
v9hYyI4Um9WxSwHzHO4BPQ 1 not good at all i had the tuna tacos and my wife had the bacon shrimp tacos both were tasteless the rice was so dry it was inedible and the black beans were straight out of a can  the service was slow and non existent we asked for lemons for water twice refill of salsa that never came another beer which also never came and they allow smoking outside in the patio  no one wants to sit beside a cigarette during dinner when we asked about the state law they said they allow people to smoke on the patio anyway 45 for 2 crappy meals and a beer we will not be back
qn9VLtVdgb0oPEWkDuczIQ 1 this was a weird dining experience  the atmosphere is like a casual dining spot but the prices we high for the offerings my wife and i spent almost 80 on 1 small app 1 dessert and 2 entrees no drinks  both entrees were wrong as if they ran out of food and were plating dishes on the fly with whatever they had nothing we ordered came out correct except the water app  deviled eggs  good flavor in the filling but the whites were extremely rubbery entree 1  sea bass topped with crab  veg medley  the sea bass was good except it didnt come with anything that it was advertised on the menu it came with fried mashed potatoes instead of the veggies  no crab meat and had pesto sauce on it i actually asked for the menu and pointed to what i thought i was getting they brought my plate back and there was literally about 14 of an oz of crab meat my wife and i just chuckled entree 2  salmon and cheesy mashed salmon was great but came with veggies instead of mashed  come to find out they ran out of mashed potatoes and we were stuck wth the veggies  who runs out of a main side dish at 630p dessert pb brownie cheesecake save your money and calories huge piece but bland and tasted kinda stale was also supposed to be topped with pb cups it wasnt by this time we were fed up and just asked for the check   we have never not finished a dessert we took it home and even the kids thought it was bad service average at best everyone had super awkward personalities and it was painful to have a conversation our waitress seemed to be frustrated with everything she would ask us how we are doing and then walk away while we were answering we waited for silverware on 2 different occasions   to top it off the ups driver wheels in 10 giant boxes right beside our table to unload in the kitchen  like i said it was a strange experience
z3lbrkGcyyMBuUpXUulb7Q 3 really cool place and the kids enjoyed customizing their pops  prices arent bad for a niche shop and the pops were very good only negative is that they are very messy the drip trays could be a bit larger
lc8OkNn6f-K-LWITgJFPbA 5 wow walked in with lower back painwalked out feeling amazing thank you dr p would definitely recommend
